Overview Counter-Strike has consistently been considered one of the best tactical shooters. After a decade of CSGO, the developers have made a significant upgrade by shifting the game to the more advanced Source 2 engine, resulting in the creation of Counter-Strike 2.For people who have never played Counter-Strike Your first match of CS is surely going to be a very unpleasing experience. Its a game that demands extensive communication, teamwork, and a deep understanding of maps. It takes a considerable amount of time to become accustomed to it, but once you do, CS can transform into an addictive game that consumes a significant portion of your free time. The game is primarily renowned for its bomb defusal mode, which is essentially a 5v5 elimination mode conducted over multiple rounds. The first team to secure a set number of rounds emerges as the overall victor. Gameplay Mechanics With the shift to Source 2, Counter-Strikes mechanics have undergone significant changes compared to what was seen in CSGO. Every round in Counter-Strike unfolds quite differently and demands a substantial amount of strategy even before engaging in combat. Both teams must carefully manage their in-game economy and establish optimal team positioning. While communication and teamwork are paramount, individual skill is also essential in a tactical shooter.In this game, each weapon possesses distinct recoil patterns, accuracy characteristics, and damage output. Mastering the recoil control for these firearms is a skill that requires many hours of practice. If youre someone who has never played a first-person shooter before, I wouldnt recommend this game, as your experience is likely to be challenging and potentially frustrating.CSGO or CS2? As someone who has invested approximately 3,000 hours in CSGO, I would still choose CS2 over Global Offensive. The simple reason is that CS2 has the potential to be everything the community has been asking for from quite a long time. While the key gameplay adjustments revolved around server tick rate and smoke usage, the launch of CS2 was somewhat underwhelming. Most of the modes available in CSGO are currently absent in CS2. Moreover, CS2 still suffers from significant bugs, and the new sub-tick system hasnt proven to be the game-changer we anticipated. There have been numerous instances where my shots seemed to pass through enemies. Im confident that the developers will eventually introduce a lot of content to the game, but its initial release appears rushed and in need of refinement.Its not Free to Play Ever since Counter-Strike became free to play, it has experienced a surge in the number of hackers. The anti-cheat system used in CSGO, known as VAC Valve Anti-Cheat, was widely considered to be one of the least effective anti-cheat measures in gaming. With CS2, were essentially getting an upgraded version of the same anti-cheat system. Unfortunately, it seems that this upgrade hasnt had a significant impact, as matchmaking is still plagued by hackers. At this point, it appears unlikely that well see substantial changes to this system.To fully enjoy the game, purchasing the Prime Status upgrade via the Steam store is necessary. This upgrade enables Prime Enabled Matchmaking, where players with Prime status are exclusively matched with other Prime players. This significantly reduces the likelihood of encountering cheaters in your matches. Matchmaking has been blessed Ive expressed frustration with CSGOs matchmaking system many times, considering it to be quite problematic. However, with CS2, there appears to be hope, as the developers have implemented significant changes to the matchmaking system. Rather than having a single rank for all maps, theyve introduced map-specific ranks. This means youll have a distinct rank for each map in the game. Furthermore, theyve provided the option to check our ELO MMR in a separate mode called Premier the next section discusses this mode!.Premier Mode The Premier mode closely resembles the original competitive mode of the game, with the only difference being that you need to veto a map from the available map pool. As insignificant as it may sound, the choice of map plays a crucial role in Counter-Strike. However, CS2 has gone a step further by introducing a new mechanic called CS Rating, which is quite similar to what we commonly refer to as ELO points. In this system, players will gain or lose ELO points based on the average ELO points of the opposing team. The best part is that you can constantly monitor these numbers during the game. Visuals and Audio To be perfectly frank, CSGO had started to show its age in terms of visuals, despite receiving ongoing graphical updates for its maps. But now, thats all in the past because CS2 has arrived with improved Source 2 lighting, stunning visuals, and impressive effects. Its truly remarkable to see how different Counter-Strike looks when its reimagined on the latest Source 2 engine. The developers have even recreated some of the old maps from the ground up, and the outcome is genuinely pleasing to the eye.Another notable feature of CS2 is its revamped audio, but from my personal perspective, I find it to be a significant downgrade compared to CSGO. It can be quite challenging to discern the source of various sounds, and even the overall voice quality is lower than what was experienced in CSGO. Additionally, they have inexplicably disabled voice chatting in the main menu, which is another frustrating change. Main Pros and ConsPros    Gameplay that emphasis both teamwork and individual skill.    Improved visual quality.    New mechanics are introduced through CS2.     Skins look better.    Better matchmaking system.    Overhauled maps.Cons    Cheaters are still a big issue.    A lot of modes are missing.    Audio quality is poorer.    Has many bugs in its current state. Tips to new playersFor new CS players, my advice is to spend a month playing the Casual mode of the game before venturing into the Competitive mode. The potential learning opportunities in CS are virtually limitless, and youll continually acquire new insights about the game. Honest Rating In my view, Counter-Strike is a must-play game for all FPS enthusiasts. However, its important to note that the initial experience can be quite challenging, and youll likely need to invest around 15 in the game to fully enjoy it. Rating 810 CSGO has good gameplay, and action that will never get boring. But it is ruined by hackers. Fun game overall, though it may at times consume too much of your day time.You will come across many toxic-salty people, just ignore-report-mute them. You will have days that you may play like a pro and feel good and your dopamine will skyrocket, but you will be accused of cheating by your victims.you will have days that you cant even get a shot and you will be told to possibly cease to exist and delete this game possibly something about your close relatives but as I said in my second point, ignore-mute-report whatever you dont like.Enjoy this game, be less toxic, obviously dont cheat what would be the point. GLHF. CSGO is my favorite gambling loophole of all time. I let my 5 year old son open cases all day and he loves it. 1010 What can you say about Counter-Strike Global Offensive? Its everything you could ever want from a first-person shooter. You can play it like a no-life gremlin, but you can also boot it up and just frick around with the lads and dads without worrying too much about strategic play. Its also a very fun eSport to watch if youre into that sort of thing. My CSGO phase is done but I will always have fond memories of rushing B sneeki beeki like. EZPZ lemon squeezy You know when youre hitting on a girl and things are going really well and then during the conversation, she slides in the fact she has a boyfriend and you die a little bit on the inside. Thats what this game feels like. CounterStrike Where the only thing more reliable than your terrible aim is the endless cheaters spinning around like theyre auditioning for Dancing with the Stars. Youll learn real fast that the only thing more accurate than your gunshots are the cheaters aimbots, which somehow always seem to have perfect aim. But hey, at least youll get to experience the sweet, sweet thrill of a game where everything looks fine until you die in 0.1 seconds to someone whos clearly not from this dimension. But dont worry, Valves totally on it. Im sure theyre working hard on that anti cheat system. Any day now. In the meantime, enjoy getting headshot by a guy whos both floating and twerking through the map.1010 would totaly throw my keyboard across the room again. Your team in every random competitive game- You- Russian Guy- Another Russian Guy- A 6 year old kid who slept with your mother- Russian Guy who speaks English1010 Hi valve just wondering now that csgo is free to play is it possible that you could reward those that have originally purchased the game.for those idiots who cant read im not asking for no refund im simply saying maybe they should give us a free key or a nice skin as a rewardsorry comments are now disabled since all the toxic fucks in the comments and was getting bored of deleting comments The game where you think youre better than anyone else because you devoted 22 years of your life to mastering it, only to continue getting eco 1deaged from across the map on a awp full util buy by a kid that just launched the game for the first time 3 hours ago. After some hours of CS GO I have discovered that learning Russian and Turkish or such languages can be done within no time in this game also a lot cheaper than paying for classesCan recommend this Language Simulator even though it can be quite explicit at times Do NOT worry about hackers in this game, there are less hackers than players who should not be allowed to use a microphone!Would definitely learn a new language again. Great game without any bugs. great game, lots of cheaters. Good Fried Chicken RecipeIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce optional, for added flavor, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours.When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 34 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees.Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly.Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. Counter Strike was once a great game, still good, but too bad its full of cheaters and scammers.Anti cheat system is a joke. This game would be amazing, if it was free of cheaters and scammers. After 19 years playing it, I didnt improve my skills in-game.However, I learned new language skills now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese.Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as   Dark Eyes or Garota de Ipanema The Girl from Ipanema In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.Better than any psychiatric therapy. 1010 Well it looks as though Counter-Strike Global Offensive is coming to an end soon. It makes me sad to think about. This game has had a big impact on my life. Ive been playing since the game came out, countless memories. This here video game has to be one of the most refined games i have ever played. Using of the heart of Quake CSGO has proven to be the best FPS to date. CSGO accomplishes so much. This game lets gun play become art. Its almost as if every spray you preform is a unique signature or tag. The guns are consistent and balanced in an refreshing way. Beyond gun play there is the movement. Bunny hopping, surfing, air-strafing, long-jumping. All of these incredible feature with an almost infinite skill ceiling. Zoom out again you have excellent maps, developer and community made. Each map featuring a unique history and lore. If we take another step back from the basic game play CSGO has Skins, and oh baby do i like skins. The style and progression of concept throughout the years. A flourishing economy of trade. Interesting stickers and personal ones that hold the value of a team or moment in time. All of these beautiful ideas and feature of CSGO are blended into this master craft of a video game. I mean im barely scratching the surface of depth there is to this iconic online shooter, but i will end this mindless rant with one last appreciation. The developers have stuck with the soul of the community from the start of this game. They have listened and acted with and for the players. Valve has always understood what it means to host a game of this nature, and they should be acknowledged for it. So from one of those players, genuinely, Thank you Valve! Joke review?

        "text": "A year has passed. Armory update is a cash grab with no real gameplay value. VAC nowhere to be found, no new maps, the CSGO community has been wiped off the face of the earth. Disgusting company Unfortunately, it is truly a great game ruined by cheaters.I had a very long break from CS and gaming in general, so I was pretty excited to get back and enjoy the gameplay. That happened to be impossible as in at least 20 of your games youll match up against someone cheating.Back in 2014-2017 you would also occasionally meet someone cheating, but usually on higher ranks such as LE, LEM, SMFC, GE, thats why I think they cheated in the first place  to get to higher ranks and stay there.Downloading CS years later and having 0 skill left I was surprised to find out that now you have silvers and novas flooded with cheaters, which makes 0 sense to me  What is those guys goal? Why are they ranked so low using cheats? So, in 2025 cheating is not something you occasionally find among high-ranks competing between each other, but rather an issue you simply cannot avoid. Among other things, this makes the game very unfriendly for newbies who expect to play against someone in their skill bracket.Someone might say you are just bad and thats why you think others cheat and while I get this POV, it is simply not the case. I might not be good anymore but I certainly remember the games physics and stuff like that. Its quite easy to detect a cheater when you played the game for the first time in 2003. Also, a 0 level, 1 year old, 50 hours in game Steam account having 80 HS is simply something very, very suspicious.Also someone might say just dont play on Valves servers, go to FACEIT. Firstly, I just want to casully play the game for an hour to relax, not to be all competitive and ruin others desire to win. Secondly, why cant the game be playable out of the box with no need to have any kind of add-ons?Well, I guess enough for a review. This game will forever stay in my heart as it has brought an incalculable amount of fun into my life back in the days. And it also might bring it to someone today. But unfortunately not to me. Game has been completely ruined and it has nothing to do with the bugs etc, tbh it looks and plays great it is a decent successor to cs-go once you iron out the kinks.. However, the cheaters... premier matchmaking... faceit... You decided to break all of it, the entire game. Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldnt do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either... Then there is the false bans I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence... Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we cant because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game... You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You dont punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it. I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming major. You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback. Counter Strike has one of the most dedicated communities and I am sure if you paid even a fraction of it back to us that investment would pay off ten fold for you guys. I bought CSGO 10 years ago, why has it been replaced with CS2?!Ikea never came in my house while I was away to replace my black chair with a yellow armchair they thought was better!Its not an update, its a different product!Put my purchase back in my library! Honest review of an nearly 15 year playerGame has come a long way. SInce very first CS up to this point. Current trends actually killed this game for good. I dont think I will ever come back to it. I cant imagine going F2P on this game is a good idea purely because of cheaters and scummy players. Matchmaking is awful as is thus i see no reason to TRY to have fun playing. Battle royale? I am waiting for new Need for Speed to have that gamemode too kappa. I dont know, I am honestly disappointed, once again by this game. Best FPS ever made has actually hit rock bottom by not being itself anymoreEDITI can see that people who have the same opinion as me are usually more experienced, whereas people that are basically new and have under 2 years of playtime would just be toxic and be part of this perfect cancer-free community. Shame, but I like the discussion.Also, having a blast reading this game is not 15 years oldEDIT2CS2 released, things changed, this review is outdated Alright, Ive been playing CS since 1.6. I know CSGO had a rough first year after release, but CS2 really is something else. As someone that used to do tournaments and events with a team as a former semi-pro back in the day, this game has steered so far to terrible that its just not worth wasting time on until its in a proper playable state. Its a shell of what once was one of the most optimised FPSs out there and many other current pro players and former pro players will tell you the same thing. If you have a ping above 20, forget about it. The glitches, the cheaters, the lack of network utilisation, the lack of support for content creators, the deceit etc.. Theres just so much wrong with this game right now. This review may change later, but Im dead sick of trying to enjoy it as it once was. Perhaps its my fault for moving over to Starlink, perhaps Im getting old, or perhaps the years beforehand were my imagination, but no, its not the case because others have the exact same issues and it seems Valve has turned a blind eye to them. I appreciate the upgrade in fidelity, but I really miss Arms Race, Danger Zone,... which allowed me to practice CS in a fun way. Im not a 100 hardcore dude, and since I cant play CSGO anymore I really feel like I can spend my time better with other games. Its disappointing to see how this game is evolving. The lack of concern for cheaters in the servers is appallingthere are no effective anti-cheat measures in place, nothing at all. I wouldnt recommend wasting your time on this its essentially a playground for cheaters to compete over who has the best hacks. Even some so-called pro-players are resorting to cheating. Honestly, theres not much more to sayjust save yourself the frustration and avoid this mess. The lack of effective Anti-Cheat forces veteran players that wish to take this game seriously to play on 3rd party clients, which divides the community massively. However unfortunately as it stands there are also cheat bypasses for popular 3rd party clients too such as FACEIT. It feels as if Valve cares more about the economy of the skin market than they do about the actual gameplay which is understandable looking at the annual turnover of cases. Im not going to recommend this game untill they add PROPER ANTI-CHEAT. This game got replaced. The reviews are from csgo which was a way better game. They replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game.CS 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps, community servers, battle royale, surf, zombies mods and more. Additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when I cannot play at all which never happened in csgo.This game is incomplete and shouldnt take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully.New graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasnt worth it. I was hyped for CS 2 but its not ready to replace CS GO and they shouldnt remove an existing game and turn off CSGO servers, it should be just a separate game as it always was with CS series.I feel scammed especially that I bought CSGO when it was still a paid game. They took a game I paid for and replaced with some silly remake. Full of cheaters, Anti-Cheat doesnt work, Not Optimized, full of bugs,The mechanics are faulty and many more.... .Bring Back CSGO. It doesnt worth it to play. There are a lot of things I can forgive...for example -Getting matched with russians since 2012-Afks,griefers,derankers,kids screaming into a 5 mic,wannabe djs,hackers-Footsteps sounding like an elephant walking around-Shotgun from 2M doing 97 dps as a headshot-AWP and other skins that cost as much as a Merc S600-Ranking adjustmentsBUT THERE IS ONE SIN I CANT AND WONT FORGIVE AND THAT IS REMOVING AZTECITS BEEN YEARS BRING MY MAP BACK YOU FUCKING BASTARDS. Imagine it being over a year since the release of a game and there are still 3 maps from the OFFICIAL trailer for CS2 that arent in it yet. This most recent update is a testament to this development teams utter incompetence. After 3,100 hours I can honestly say that this game will provide you with exhaustion, weakness, and desire to sleep as well as send you straight to the treatment ward in a medical facility with stage 4 cancer. One thing i dont understand how there are still people cheating in matchmaking for 8 years straight, I alone have invested enough money into CSGO for a single freelance programer to develop an anti-cheat system that actually works but instead the developers of the game are too greedy to care. Valve did an Activision-Blizzard, and force upgraded everyone playing CSGO to play Counter Strike 2 -- so Valve which is it a sequel or a major patch??On top of that they replaced the store page so all the millions of reviews and stats are now attributed to CS2 even though they were earned by CSGO, underhanded and disgusting behaviour.I expect better from Vavle of all companies. I cannot support this. 1 Year since release.  Hardly any anti cheat improvements, removed gamemodes, removed live games, removed OverWatch system, no seasons as promised, and now we get the barebones BattlePass with no missions, no co-op missions, no new maps, no new game modes, no medal and less rolls for 3-4 more then your average CSGO Operation Pass.  Yikes. Uninstalling. Ive been playing CS since 1.3. I played them all, 1.5 1.6, go, and now cs2. Incredible game, but the competitive scene is full of hackers, not only blatant ones, but also sudden.I have incredible reputation, old account, lots of reviews, and valve keeps matching me with 50 hours old accounts. Ridiculous.  Matchmaking is BROKEN. Im not enjoying any match since my brain goes, he must be hacking every 1 minute.BYE Counter-Strike 2 A Masterclass in DowngradesAh, Counter-Strike 2. The long-awaited, heavily hyped, Source 2-powered evolution of the greatest tactical shooter of all time. And what did we get? A broken mess that makes you appreciate Counter-Strike Global Offensivea game we all spent years complaining about.First, lets talk about the servers. You ever wanted to experience what its like to time travel? Well, now you can! Thanks to CS2s incredible sub-tick system, every gunfight feels like youre guessing where the past version of your opponent might be, while the future version of yourself is already dead. Laggy peeks, input delay, and rubberbanding galoreits like Valve found the worst possible way to implement online gameplay and ran with it.Then, we have the cheaters. Oh boy. If you ever dreamed of playing against professional aimlock enthusiasts in every second game, CS2 has you covered. The VAC system? Think of it as a museum piecenice to look at but completely useless. Mass reporting doesnt work, the cheaters never get banned, and somehow, they always win. Its almost impressive.But dont worry, CS2 did bring improvements! They gave us volumetric smokesbecause thats what everyone wanted, right? Not better matchmaking, not reliable hit registration, but dynamic, 3D smokes that look cool while you get shot through them by someone using wallhacks.Meanwhile, Valorant exists, a game that actually runs well, has anti-cheat that does something, and doesnt make you question if your bullets are real or just imaginary suggestions to the game engine.Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is like getting a birthday gift from Valve where they take away your old toy and give you a newer, shinier, but completely broken version of it. 010 experience when playing, 1010 experience when uninstalling. Counter-Strike 2 has been rushed into live compounded by the moronic decision to replace CSGO completely instead of being its own game.CS2s implementation of the networking system, Subtick, is god fucking awful and in my opinion is vastly inferior to CSGO. I have never felt like I have no idea where my bullets are going until CS2. I can be dead on some one with my crosshairs, steady stance, unload a mag in precise bursts and the server reports zero hits. There have been plenty of clear blatant examples of poor hit rig with people shooting point blank on someone not moving and still missing, just watching the bullets go right through them.The aggravating meme of Ferrari peeks is ridiculous and there is no humanly way to fight someone that either doesnt appear on your screen until you are already dead, getting fucked by ghosts seemingly or seeing them for a fraction of a second giving the same outcome.Playing against teams that just rush with P90s is like getting brutally ass fucked by a rusty, unlubed, bad dragon dildo without consent or courtesy to spit first which you are powerless to stop...unless you stop playing. Its even worse with peekers advantage being so bad that if you are even a semi-decent shot, someone with an AK-47 will be hitting your power off button more times than a retarded monkey in an IT shop.Lets not get started on the fact that what replaced a playable CSGO on all spectrums network and performance has been replaced with a very poorly optimised mess that requires a top-end PC to have even semi-decent FPS. While with CSGO you could have a relatively low-end system and still play at reasonable FPS - now this eldritch monstrosity will sap every ounce of power from your rig and cry out for more.Change your beta branch to CSGO and wait a very fucking long time to play this garbage. Infuriating is the kindest way you could call the CS2 experience. The worst most popular video game This game shouldnt be alive no more, we are letting this company get away with zero effort content while the servers are on fire and the anti-cheat is non-existent.These issues have been there for years, and it just keeps getting worse.. Game kept alive with tournaments and the fact that everyone will lose their hard earned money if the game economy dies. Cheaters have always been there, they just moved from community servers to playing premier when it came out. Probably 910 matches have at least one of them, with the exploits possible nowadays, you wont be able to even tell perfect silent, etc..Content wise all we have gotten past 5 years is small map changes and more ways to dry out peoples wallets Armory. This is just the beginning of it, i would be here writing for the next 2 years if i tried to list everything wrong with this game, if you value your mental health at all, stay away from this game and its toxic n idiotic community.",

Alright, fellow masochistic puzzle lovers, have you ever looked at a game and thought, I absolutely hate this, but why cant I stop playing? Welcome to I Hate This Game  a title that both describes the game and your feelings towards it in real-time.  Brain-Busting Gameplay   Every level feels like the game devs sat in a room and asked, How can we mess with players minds today? The gameplay morphs faster than a chameleon on a rainbow. One minute, youre solving a puzzle thinking youre the next Einstein, the next, youre wondering if you even know how computers work.  Interactivity Overload   Remember when your folks told you not to touch everything you see? Throw that advice out the window. In this game, youll find yourself clicking, dragging, and possibly even yelling at every pixel on your screen. Is that a button? No? Maybe? WHY WONT YOU WORK?!  Verdict  I Hate This Game is like that weird food combo you tried on a dare and ended up craving. Its frustrating, chaotic, and makes you question your life choices... but in the best way possible. Dive in, and remember to interact with everything. And I mean, everything.Rating  Hate the game, love the challenge. P.S. If you see me online at 3 AM trying to figure out that one level, send help... or snacks. Preferably snacks.   LoveHateRelationshipWithThisGame   Just 13.37 Hrs IN Puzzle game with 100 of shorts level you can explore. Some level was quite funny some were disturbingly ridiculous to figure it out by yourself. You have to use A LOT of your imagination. However, it quite fun and hilarious. Finish whole game in 4.5 hours. Recommended for those who love quirky puzzle game. A game where you get stuck inside a game and have to do puzzles to get out. every single level has its own unique style and concept to it and dont worry its not a short game either 49100 Dont let the graphics fool you this is still a good little brain teaser with some humor and great music. There are 100 normal, 10 hard and 10 secret levels. You may need a guide for some of the hard and secret levels.The GoodGreat chiptune musicClever and often think-outside-the-boxmeta puzzlesPuzzle hints available if you get stuckGood playtime for the price even better when on saleYMMVSome rooms are just platforming.There are a few puzzles relying on knowledge of music, logic gates, programming and other games. However, theyre still intuitive enough to figure out.A couple puzzles that relied on sound. Im not sure how youd complete them if you were deaf, since the patterns changed on reload.The Bad-Forced to use WASD movement, adding a lot of frustration to platforming for those that dont use it. I wouldnt say this game is strictly a logic game - Id rather call it a time killer. Althought there are levels that require some thinking, most of them are trivial and based rather on guessing what the author meant instead of real challenge. Some levels were fun and this game isnt a bad way to spend one evening or two.And for so low price I wouldnt expect much more, so I give it a positive review . My mind is consumed by a swirling tempest of disdain for this wretched game, each moment spent with it feels like a descent into an abyss of despair and frustration. A mix of very special riddles. Hard to learn character movement and there are some mean decisions from the developer to annoy you. It opens your mind to think more freely. Chiptune music in this title is gorgeous as f. Had a great time with this game and awaiting a sequel. I definitely like the challenges and the soundtrack... I hate this game! If you wanna try something weird and sometimes puzzling and not too long. This is a classic nice game for that. its kinda hard but its so fun and all the levels are fun and there is secerts. A puzzle game featuring a collection of 100 short levels, each demanding a unique solution. While some of the puzzles are quite creative, there are certainly quite a few that fall short. Even the ones I liked did not blow me away with any cool, never seen before concepts. Overall, its an alright puzzle gameI didnt love it, but I didnt hate it either. A simple, fun platformer thats exactly what it says on the tin. Especially for this price point, I highly recommend it. I love this game!!! Its not often something truly unique comes along and shakes up how we think about gaming.  There are 100 levels, plus some bonuses and secrets, that all require you to exit a room in very different and clever ways.  The game plays with the concept of technology and how we use our computers to game, and since I am not that tech- savvy I did have to resort to YouTube University for help on more than one occasion.  After a certain amount of time in a level, a hint is available, but the hints are clues only, and will not always be crystal clear in helping you finish a level.  This game is amazing! I love I Hate This Game! Fun game that offers a nice variety of puzzles to solve. On some levels conrols are not great, which can be a reason for a lot of failures and a course of annoyance. Other than that, I highly recommend this one. --- Graphics --- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it MS-DOS--- Gameplay --- Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Watch paint dry instead Just dont--- Audio --- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Im now deaf--- Audience --- Kids Teens Adults Grandma--- PC Requirements --- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer--- Difficulty --- Just press W Easy Easy to learn  Hard to master Significant brain usage Difficult Dark Souls--- Grind --- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboardsranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding--- Story --- No Story Some lore Average Good Lovely Itll replace your life--- Game Time --- Long enough for a cup of coffee Short Average Long To infinity and beyond--- Price --- Its free!

Despite its name, I actually really enjoyed it. The puzzles are very interesting to solve and are pretty accessible to complete, so your brains wont fry in the end. And the most interesting part is that puzzles are very unique to each other and the vast majority of them break the fourth wall and require some sort of unique interaction. Sometimes youll have to do something outside of the game in order to complete a level and this is why this game is amazing.Also, while solving puzzles, you will encounter a very well-made soundtrack that suits the overall theme of the game. All in all, the game is fairly short in term of gameplay hours. It took me three hours to complete all levels and get all achievements. But its totally worth it, especially for its low price.10 haters out of 10",

        "text": "This is a game akin to things like the impossible quiz, where its less of a puzzle and more deciphering what the game wants you to do. This is fine in theory, but this game also has puzzles where it just expects you to know something that most people dont, such as binary, circuitry and music notes. Good puzzles should present you with every piece of the puzzle then let you put them together, not rely on knowledge someone may or not have.Now, I cant complete the game because I cant read music, and that shouldnt even be expected of me. the game will ask you to visit websites, send emails, change pc settings, and more.i do not like to do that so i refunded the game I hate this game. It has absolutly no unique ideas in the anti-game genre and you can get the same experience from just playing something free on miniclip or itch.io Sorry, but the Maze is unplayable if you have twitching hands. Apparently theres no way to skip levels either so i just... cant play Quantity over quality. Feels like trying to beat someones random Game Maker games on their old Windows XP machine just because. Really wasnt doing it for me. how is hiding a code to progress lvl outside of the game considered a puzzle? i guess creator didnt find a creative way to bring some traffic to the website of this game and decided just to force players to literally type in url that was written in the lvl in order to obtain passcode it aint goodi think its trying to be a kind of clever puzzle game sorta thing like baba is you in a platformer format, but it doesnt really have the characteristic wit required to take on that task and overall the game engine is very clunkyits not expensive, but i couldnt get more than 30 minutes of playtime out of it before i quit from lack of inspiration, so there are definitely better ways of spending your time and money I hate this game, there bad puzzles, all of them are either too simple or just like what. As someone who designs puzzles often, the trick to them is being able to know the basic idea of what you have to do. Like in portal you place 2 or more portals to get to the exit. In this game its copy my favorite phrase. What does that mean, you dont know because it doesnt follow any of the basic rules of making a puzzle. Sorry Pixel error, I think its a good idea and obviously some people like it, but its just not for me. Im dumb, obviously. The game clearly states how youll feel when you play. The controls are horrible, the puzzles are impossible to figure out if you dont have some previous knowledge, stupidly simple, or made hard by the controls. Its trying to be frustrating, but it does it a bit too well. I hate this game.Not because it wasnt good.But the fact that I payed for it while it feels like it couldve been free.2.510 Thought itd be a fun puzzle game, but the puzzles are lacking in creativity and are just downright annoying to do. One puzzle wanted me to type a link into my internet browser to find out a seven number code to open the door, another urged me to change my computers clock. The platforming is clunky and inaccurate and I would often spawn right on the edge of a platform, only to then fall into the void without touching my keyboard. I really do hate this game, but not for the reasons I thought I would when I bought it. The title doesnt lie. Youll actually fcking hate this game. I stopped at level 69 duo to glitch , basically the map is wrong!!!! This looks like a game that will test my mental endurance2 hours laterI take that back....this game was a waste of time Opens up Baba Is You I completed this great and very well made gamenot recommended this is the hardest game ever i see i hate this game. witty, but it was meh for me I hate this game I love this game",

        "text": "Peace, Death! is a fun arcade game where you play as a Grim Reaper and sentence clients to either Heaven Right, Hell Left, or Purgatory Down.The game is all about analyzing each client and observing their attributes before giving them their sentence. Demons and murderers go to Hell, non-threatening humans go to Heaven, etc. The game mixes things up as clients start wearing accessories and carrying objects that need to be examined by clicking on them. Sometimes they will drop the object, or the object might have been covering an important trait of theirs. For example, removing a hat might reveal devil horns, which means that you should sentence this client to Hell.There are also random mini games that happen as you play to break the repetition of the standard game. The mini games are a bit hit and miss. Explanations are vague at best, so it is really up to the player to figure out how to complete each one.Players who liked Papers, Please will probably get a good kick out of this game. High-speed sentencing of clients can become repetitive, but it also tests your endurance, so it becomes up to the player to keep their focus or suffer the consequences.The game isnt too long, and I was able to beat it in roughly 3 hours. I dont really see myself playing it again, but it was a good time while it lasted.

For those that find papers please too hard or want to have a laugh then Id recommend this game instead Yep, cool game and nice little time killer.Gameplay is very straightforward.  For each candidate, you take a look at them and decide whether they should go to Heaven or Hell.  At first, it starts off with very simple things like Does he have devil horns? or Is he clutching a Bible? but over the course of 7 weeks, a new qualifier is added every day.  By the end, you may be saying to yourself, Normal eyes under the eyeglasses, had blood on his chest from a crime committed but it turned out he was a murder victim, isnt a clown, held a Bible but renounced his faith, blood at his feet that wouldnt wash away, so what does this add up to? ... all on a 4 second time limit.  Now do this again for 45 clients in a row.Extra wrinkles may be thrown at you throughout the work day, such as attempts to smuggle contraband into the afterlife, telephone calls from intern Reapers asking for advice, or catastrophes on Earth suddenly flooding your office with unexpected overflow of souls to judge.  These add some nice pacing shifts to the gameplay and serve to keep you a bit off balance.Unavoidable comparisons will be drawn to Papers, Please, and in fact this is quite similar in concept, though much simpler in execution.  Three keys on your keyboard and your mouse cursor left click are all you need and each work day lasts around two minutes.  Unlike Papers, there is no replay value here there are no decisions to make and only a single ending which amounts to Youre done.  This is all fine and the game is not trying to be deep or thought-provoking.At just a few bucks, this is pretty cool.  I picked it up on sale for about 3.50 and definitely got my moneys worth.  The full price of 5 is worth it as long as you remember not to expect anything mindblowing. Oh, man.Man, oh man.Let me tell you why you should play with great game.Peace, Death is a brilliant, cameo-filled, pop culture clicker game with enough great references, nice character designs, and funny dialogue to keep anyones attention. It keeps you engaged with fast-paced decision making, as well as the aforementioned silliness that almost never gets old.Youre the judge of judges, sending your targets to Heaven or Hell maybe more, because you wanted a snack, and your fridge was empty. You take up a position with Apocalypse Inc, who is responsible for the aforementioned. Under Death, Famine, War, and Pestilence, you need to keep calm with catastophes galore - Im not going to spoil too much. Youll figure it you.Theres enough achievements to keep you entertained and busy, and from what Ive seen, I dont think Ill get bored of this game for a while.Ive not had this much fun with a 5.00 game since my last review of that Neko Sim.But, this game is ten times more awesome. Hands down. I dont know how else to express that.If youre reading this to make a decision on a purchase, buy this.You wont regret it. Peace, Death! is a completely insane Papers, Please in hell. You decide whether clients get into heaven, hell or purgatory and such a simple sounding concept evolves to be one of the most thrilling very few buttons but so massive content experiences I have personally ever seen.This game has a MASSIVE amount of content and so many changed to the simple formula that it stays interesting, fun and novel at the same time for the entire road. It has tons of pop culture references, dozens of easter eggs and so much detail put into it that I hardly can believe it is based on simple pixel graphics.Probably the indie game with the utmost most amount of soul Ive played in quite a while. And Im not talking about the actual gameplay here. This has practically dethroned Papers, Please in my personal book of indie titles, which is quite the accomplishment. Peace, Death! is a fast paced, increasing difficulty based game where you play as a Reaper whos forced to work for Death itself when he figures he needs some cash real bad.Your job starts off nice and easy, you just have to send your clients to Heaven, Hell or Purgatory. This task only gets harder as you move forward, with the game throwing at you more and more details to pay attention to, distractions, mini-games, and whatnot. The controls are really raw furious clicking and WASD are going to be your best friends.The somewhat pixelated art style is quite neat, and mixes well with the colours of the game.The dialogues are simple but fun and the game is pretty much filled with quotes and references from other videogames, tv shows, movies, and such, which make the experience very enjoyable and will also make you go OmgwherehaveIseenthisbeforeImustremember.The rockmetal creepy soundtrack is also a really remarkable feature of this game. Whats better than condamning people while angry guitars and drums play in the background?It is relatively short but if you like tryharding and really wanna up your Reaper game then its replay value acquires a whole new spirit.Sending people to hell has never been this hard. I completed this game 100Advice Dont, its not a fun game to replay for over 40 hoursThis is a 2 hour game, that you finish once and never look backThe price is cheap but wait for a saleThe DLC tho is one hundred percent not worth it, do not buy it, you wont even get to see half of the content because of how grindy it is and what you do get to see is just mindless repetition with nothing fun happeningThe achievements are borderline broken, A rank for the playthrough is impossible without perfect play, which is, cheatingI will still recommend because the main game is not as offensive as the DLC Cool little game. Reminds me of Papers Please. The english could use some work though. It is a little broken and can be difficult to understand even as a native speaker. MEH If you had played paper please or similar sorting games and wished the game to be much simpler, this game might be for you. It is basically a sorting game deciding the person to go to hell or heaven depending on the qualification that the game defines.  I had fun for a while but got bored after realizing its basically a repeat with lots of variations but i didnt like paper please for same reason. So this type of game is not for me maybe. I hate the game when it feels like working at the office. But this games not bad. The art and story-line is pretty solid and for sorting game, they sure add a lot of variation for you to enjoy. They did best with the genre that they can offer. So thumb up for the effort. .        ,    .         . ,         ,              .       .    .          .          .   . American-Mexican border simulator, but with cool effects Judgment calls. As a new employee of Death its your job to deliver the souls of the deceased to heaven, purgatory or hell.Game is a point-and-click rogue-lite puzzle with simple 8bit-like graphics, very few soundtracks and plenty of humour and references about both the fictional and the real-life. You earn money after finishing a level and can spend it in order to make your job easier or harder on the next one, if you so desire plus do some odd jobs for, not only Death, but to the other three Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Its also a short game. Each level has between 30-50 souls to judge and they can be beaten in about 2 or so minutes, if youre quick.Beware, though An insufferable co-worker of yours will CONSTANTLY nag you with phone calls and theres a safe-unlocking mini-game that, while simple, gets pretty irritating, later on. Its fun but can get boring quick with basically doing the same thing the whole game Heres the premise You are a reaper, one of thousands living in the underworld. You cant afford food, so you start working at Apocalypse Inc. as a customer service rep. Although your boss is Death, the other coworkers are always plotting against him, sometimes asking you to help in their schemes. On the factory floor, you have the simple job of deciding if a person goes to heaven, hell, or purgatory based on their face and person effects. Game design is essentially a simplified version of Papers, Please with a few minigames mixed in to shake things up. Every day you learn that something is sinful or that giving it up can pave the way for redemption. Practically, it means every time a character shows up, you click their hat, glasses, items, and blood stains if one of them doesnt go away, they go to hell.Thats really all there is to it. You judge 30-50 people per session, solve a few puzzles and twitch minigames, and use your money to either avoid making the other horsemen of the apocalypse more powerful or make the next stage easier. Unlike Papers, Please, Peace, Death doesnt have an overarching story. Events between the four horsemen of the apocalypse just happen.Thats not to say Peace, Death doesnt have some fun ideas. A big source of the comedy comes from an implication that all timelines in all conceivable dimensions are happening at the same time. So, in one universe Famine and Pestilence team up to make all food donuts, then make people allergic to donuts. Death then asks you if youd be willing to save this entire universe by paying 100 skulls to turn everyone into spiders because spiders dont eat donuts. Thats fun, its cute, and youll see many events like it throughout the game.   Unfortunately, we really cant avoid the fact that this is no Papers, Please. Though Peace, Death is purposely silly, its gameplay lacks the depth of its spiritual predecessor. In Papers, Please the timer meant something. Every day you had a near-endless line of people trying to enter your country. It was impossible to serve them all, but you were paid based on how many people you processed and how few mistakes you made in a single day. Events outside of work provided an ever-increasing need for more funds. If you cut corners or memorized content, you had a better chance of providing for your family. This made every decision in Papers, Please a moral decision, forcing you to choose between your family and increasingly desperate sob stories. In Peace, Death currency only exists to make the game easier. For a pittance of skull tokens, you can turn off negative quirks and activate positive quirks. In between, Death will ask you to foil the plans of his competitors, but it doesnt really matter. I decided to play through the entire game without ever helping Death but always helping his competitors. As a result, nothing happened. By the end of the game, I had over 700 skull tokens and Death was still 3x more powerful than the next leading horseman. In Peace, Death, your choices dont matter, theyre just a framing device for an arbitrary point race that Death will win anyway. Plus, the choices you make have no bearing on the game. If you turn an entire universe of people into spiders, you never see those spiders. If nothing outside the gameplay itself matters, then the gameplay better be really good, right?The gameplay is pretty fun. Youll be visited by a frankly huge variety of characters from Conan to Einstein, Shrek to space marines, and odd movie references. Gameplay is kept fresh by adding new rules every day and a new minigame every week. It works surprisingly well, despite that were really just clicking bloodstains and pressing S,D,W. Unfortunately, what happens in gameplay really doesnt matter either. Unlike Papers, Please, you have a set number of people to process with a time limit. That means theres a maximum amount of skull tokens you can make per day, which means theres a maximum skull token cap for the entire game, which means donation of 100 skull tokens to stop the other horsemen is not only pointless in the meta game, its actually harmful to replayabiltiy. Theres a cap on how well you can do and although you get an overall report card at the end of the game which lists every single one of your failures, theres no incentive to go faster, cut corners, or make exceptions. Everything that made Papers, Please a unique and biting experience isnt present in Peace, Death and frankly the game is weaker for it.Because theres a limited number of recognizable character models, youll see the same people hundreds of times. They dont ask for anything, most of them just yell at you. Theres no reason to consider them. If Papers, Please made you feel the emotional weight of being a cog in a totalitarian system, then Peace, Death makes you feel like youre filing endless paperwork at the office. If you loved the TPS report scenes in Office Space, youll probably like Peace, Death. Very stylish brain exercise with several interesting mechanics, outstanding pixel art, attractive soundtrack and a lot of slight humor.

This liitle game is a fun and humorous way to train your concentration and memory.There are lots of pop culture references which give you little surges of dophamine when you manage to recognise them in this hasty Grim Reaper busy day.Beware the annoying trainee though wholl keep calling you  and screw your reaction speed p A game very similar to Papers, Please, Peace, Death! offers the same style of gameplay. However, instead of the rather serious tone of aforementioned game, Peace, Death! offers humor, pop-culture references and morbidly cute visuals for its interestingly dark subject matter.  I love how relatable the opening cutscene is, and how amusing the disasters can be when they occur. While it does not have a lot of replayability, it is 100 worth the money and worth the first time playthrough, if for just the experience alone. An excellent game! This is a fine example of how a simple concept can be made incredibly fun with the right execution. In Peace, Death!, you are one of the Reapers - employees hired by the Death horseman, and your job is to judge clients in the afterlife and send them either to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory, based on a specific set of rules. It starts simple at first, and then with each in-game day, you get more and more rules introduced, such as anyone with horns or holding a weapon goes to Hell, or anyone with glowing white eyes or holding a Bible goes to Heaven, or anyone who renounces their sins goes to Purgatory, and so on, and you have to keep track of all these criteria.The whole thing is timed, so you have to keep up some pace with your decisions, and you cant afford to make too many mistakes or else you fail. In addition, there are other events that can happen too, such as you getting to crack safes with smuggled goods, or a phone rings and another reaper asks you for assistance, as if youre not busy enough as it is. Or you might get some sort of a catastrophe occur, triggered by one of the other horsemen, anything ranging from a WWII scenario, to a medieval castle siege, to a scuffle over food in a random mall, and you get an influx of dead people waiting for your judgement, so in those moments you have to be even quicker than normal and get a streak in order to gain extra pointsfavour.Its pretty enjoyable and really gets your mind exercising. I think a game like this can really help to improve ones cognitive ability at making quick decisions, because you cant afford to overthink on any of your decisions in the game. It is timed, but its not unfair in that regard I never had a timer run out. However, finishing a level in quicker time nets you more points. And as you make progress in the game, you learn which features are the most important to look out for in order to get through your clients faster and with more efficiency.Some aspects of gameplay can feel a little unfair or feel like a big difficulty spike introduction of paradox agents certainly comes to mind, as does the introduction of runners who bum rush their way into Heaven without your consent, but you do get used to them with some practice.At the end of each levelday, you get graded for how well you did, which affects your rank and overall score in the end.The presentation is superb. The pixel art style is incredibly charming and pleasing on the eyes. Music is pretty great. And the sound effects are well chosen. The number of times you get to click on blood stains, food items, weapons, hats, or sunglasses that your clients come with, and those sounds are always nice on the ears, which tells me they were madechosen very carefully so not to annoy the player. And all the references and humour are pretty great. Some of the clients youll judge will be various characters from games and movies, as well as Youtube personas, real people, or historical figures. Do expect to come across the likes of Donald Trump, Joseph Stalin, King Leonidas, The Terminator, Cyberdemon from Doom, Agent 47, The Bride from Kill Bill, and many many others at some point.I think with a game like this, you might either get bored in 10 minutes or you might end up enjoying it so much that you can see yourself coming back to it frequently in the future since its easy to jump into at any time and play for as short or as long as you want.I would highly recommend it due to its incredible entertainment value, but also for it being a wonderful tool for improving your decision-making cognitive abilities. PS Theres a DLC too. Its like a fast paced papers please.  Challenging but eases you into it all so youre not too overwhelmed.",

The game that gives up on its plot about a ninth of the way in.Ill start by stating, I recieved this product while it was on sale for 2.79. The game, admittedly, is ludicriously expensive for what it is, and the price I got it for seems way more reasonable for what its worth. Dont be surprised, however for the type of game it is, I wasnt expecting much.Lets go ahead and say it- this game is not Papers, Please, the game this one really wants to be. However, while Papers, Please is a heart-aching experience designed to give you anxiety of a Border Guard, Peace, Death! Is less about story and more about gameplay.The Gamplay is incredibly simple. Those with a clear conscience go to Heaven, while Denziens go to Hell. If they wear a hat, click it to reveal features hidden. Covered in blood? Click it, and if it washes away, send them to purgatory. Watch out for the seven sins, too- they go to hell, unless they give the sins up, then purgatory it is. Are they a Clown? Straight to Hell. Ignore everything else. Glowing eyes? What colour? Send them to the places that co-ordinate with it. Watch out for Rats, and evil warlords, and flying meat. Having fun yet? No? Thats fine, I wasnt either.As you can see, there are many achievements. These achievements are literally obtained by A-ing every level, which is far too much effort for me to want to continue. By the way, this game is absolutely stocked with references and lol-so-random moments of different programmes and TV shows, none of which I recognised. If thats your shtick, go right ahead.Remember- opinion is subjective! If you want to try it for yourselves, do so. Im not about to tell you what to do.-Joseph Originally it was a positive review. However, as I continued to play, bugs started to appear within this game and original concept had fallen apart. Game had solid mechanics in first half, however I have two weeks left in campaign and everything just collapsed unto itself. Now it is just RNG game where you hope game does not screws you up from positive score.It is fine little game. However, it has many faults with its design which after few hours become annoying. Entire campaign is introducing new mechanics over old ones. Often game does not give any examples of how to deal with it. Neither first person in line is with a new mechanic. This awkward introduction of new things into the game means that you often have to restart a day if you want a good score as you are likely just to forget some new obscure thing added to a game. This rather takes away from gameplay especially as there is no restart function. You have to give up, get a bad score, sometimes even listen to monologue and story events in campaign, go through power up window for a new mission only to go back to previous mission and forget about any of this. For such fast paced game, it is certainly not designed for easy gameplay and has so many unnecessary steps. Then there are gameplay mechanics added in a middle of a mission and never explained. Some are simple, like pressing on falling rats. Others confuse you at like with cooking stew. It just appears and Glutony always complains even if you did it right. Then there are statues who attack you. Should you send them to Hell? Never explained and hope that you are not on Hardcore mode or else it is game over for you. All those mini-games takes away from experience as you are racing against a clock and if you want to score A, it is RNG element which ruins your runs.Another issue is that paradox agents and some models are poorly done. Due to pixel graphics, models have to have distinctive contours in order to be easily recognisable. Some of them do not have that and it is nearly impossible to tell which person is that. While other paradox agents are very easy to tell on a spot. This RNG mechanic is poorly implemented. In addition, due to high amount of models which are randomised with features, it is inevitable that some combinations will be terrible. For example, spaggeti man does not work with devil horns and they are very hard to spot. There are more models which are inconsistent like that.My final complaint is that this game introduces countless mechanics, but does not allow you to simply...play the damn game. It is always something new, some random mini game which takes away from experience. There is no option to disable those minigames which you do not want and just enjoy game in endless mode.Game is also bugged. I had Spartan who refused to drop his shield, so I sent him to Hell. However game registered this as a mistake, because Blood washes off. Another bug is when you receive suitcase, but have only few seconds to solve a puzzle. Puzzle however is not simplified nor you have any way of knowing how much time you have. You have only few seconds and you have to check a timer first and then the puzzle which is not easier.Also, game is full of various references, but due to in-game mechanics, it is impossible to acknowledge any effort which developers had put in. Since your performance is timed, you do not have time to read the text, to look at the model, remember what they are referencing, appreciate the effort. All this effort from developers are wasted and they need to introduce exploration mode into the game where they would make timer irrelevant and would judge you solely by right choices. In this mode game would try to bring as many unique characters as possible in order for you to appreciate them properly. This game is designed to be such an intense rush that errors you make does not really matter on most levels. It is better to do plenty of errors, but to shave of several seconds on your performance than to do no errors, but take longer to complete the level.I would also greatly appreciate encyclopedia where I could scroll through all the character models and see little description where it would say something about them and what developers are referencing. On top of their models they would say their phrase. That would be an amazing addition and this game has a lot of potential to grow. Together with some kind of game and game modes which would remove all the hassle of learning new mechanics and maybe would introduce some real balancing mechanic between apocalypse raiders where they try to overwhelm you with too many people in a day with their schemes and some longer term completionist mechanic. Sadly, instead of Peace, Death 2! We got some nonsensical game instead and Im afraid this game will never be fully fleshed out.In the end, it is a nice game, but it is also full of design issues which significantly takes away from the experience. Like for example unexplained score mechanics. I was balancing relationship between different reapers, but in the end it appeared that they massively take away from your final score. It was never explained and hours of grind are wasted. Then there are special characters. It was not clear what to do with them. I checked them for various signs and then sent them to heaven or hell only to discover that they actually matter. These examples are typical of poor introduction of mechanics within this game. Fun concept but it gets very repetitive real fast.Its interesting for the first half hour or so but after completing 4 out of 7 weeks of the game Im just bored to death. It took me several playsessions to get the mental strength to reach this far but the gameplay is still the same, events are the same, quests are the same, and money doesnt matter. Theyve added some minigames and events to spice things up but they are basically whatever, more annoyance than anything. Honestly I dont see myself completing the game, let alone replay it for all-perfect A ratings which are either obscure or broken because even if I do everything right and fast I still get either A or A seemingly at random. I understand the concept and it honestly is a fun idea. I just did not find it as entertaining as I assumed it would be. The controls are kind of clunky and that is weird seeing how it essentially only uses maybe four buttons...even still, I found myself, forgetting what to press, pressing the wrong button, and overall constantly going back and forth, trying to figure out dialogue and if there is any purpose to it. Just not my thing. It is a time-killer. Quite simple, a little bit funny, but quite monotonous after the 2nd week. It couldve worked 10 years ago, but games nowadays have higher standards. Fun for a while, but- bugs like you cant answer the phone sometimes, the phone ringing when after you bought a power-up to disable it for the round etc- getting an A relies too much on luck and power-ups more than skill- confusing menus if youre playing with a gamepad, you have to press the correct button instead of navigating and selecting with arrows and confirm butto, but most icons dont show READ THE FULL REVIEW Steam has a word limit HERE httpsgemsimov.comgame-reviewsfpeace-death-7C-a-review--Simple review details - I rank games on an out of 10 basis, granting up to 3 points in 3 categories, as well as a last, single point from my own self, depending on my experience with it.GAMEPLAYIn this game, reminiscent of Papers, Please, the Player must quickly decide whether to send entrants to heaven or hell based on visual indicators and particular directives. Using the A and D buttons to do the sending,  the Player must keep an eye on traits like horns, weapons, and hats, which is where the complexity and fun? of the game comes. Boons purchased with Skulls offer advantages, but the time limit, trainee calls, and various traits make achieving the coveted A rank challenging, ultimately leading to repetitive gameplay and potential frustration. While the game offers an enjoyable experience initially, its extended duration and lack of clear story progression may become tedious. The DLC attempts to alleviate monotony but falls short in saving the overall experience.23PRESENTATIONPeace, Death! is a pixel-art game, which lends itself to some very good visuals. In addition to that, it also has great sound effects and decent music, allowing for the experience to reach great heights. However, there are some issues  with sprites that utilize glasses being very problematic in regards to the Gameplay aspect of the game, as well as some grammatical fudgings diminish the otherwise great presentation of the game.23STORYThe Player is an intern for Death and must send demons to hell and people to heaven. Over time, the other three harbingers of the appocalypse Famine, War, Pestilence start giving the Player orders, and stuff gets more complex But thats not important, because the Player just goes on to day 50, passes their exam and becomes a proper emplyee. Its very simple. Too simple.13Legendary PointDoes this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time? I must admit that I was almost convinced by two things First, the way some characters look and what they say made me really like this game, but not enough to make me give it the point. Second, the fact that it is a funky job simulator game in the vein of Beat Cop and Papers, Please was almost enough to make me give it the point, as I really like that kind of game. Alas, NO, it was not enough. 01CONCLUSION510. I would say that this is an averagely good game. It is fun for a few hours and then it becomes a bothersome chore. For fans of job simulator games, try it. For folks who like pixel-art and referential humor, try it. I gently place it to rest in the bag of mediocrity. I had high hopes, I will not lie--READ THE FULL REVIEW Steam has a word limit HERE httpsgemsimov.comgame-reviewsfpeace-death-7C-a-review Peace, Death! on phones, a brief delight,On PC, a tale takes a blight.Quickly repetitive, enthusiasm drains,No changes emerge, just lingering strains. Honestly shocked to see this game put at 5. The rest of this devs games are 99 cents and have about just as much gameplay and depth as this, yet this is 5?For the boring timekiller gameplay you get out of this, definite NO on the 5 asking price.Would say to pick this up for a buck though, maybe, but only if youre looking to kill time and newgrounds just isnt doing it for you anymore. Gets boring and repetitive after 30 mintes. Finding to send them to heaven or hell is not really that rewarding. I would like to enjoy the comedic text, but you are timed so you are incentivized to skip over it. Wish the game had richer content Dishonest Trailer! Epic orchestral music plays From the developers who looked at Papers, Please and thought,What if we made it wackier, removed the emotional depth, and threw in the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?comes a game where you play as the Grim Reapers unpaid intern in PEACE, DEATH!

Enjoy chaos as well.Endless rules, no time to think,This game is a real stink. The controls in this game joypad ONLY btw are absolutely POTATO! edit - apparently there is an option to play keyboardmouse, but only if you unplug your controller, otherwise controller is the only option. Has there ever been another game that does this?? , that is just Potato! editButtons keep changing function, depeding on which screen you are on. there is no clue as to what the buttons actually do, the game just shows a bunch of buttons and when you press one, it either changes the languiche or asks if you want to delete your save game, usually in portugese. After figuring that bit out and suffering through the intro cant be skipped, I had the game switch the orientation of the keypad on me so I kept sending souls to the wrong place. just...how?Continuing the game consists of guessing which button to press, which hopefully gives you the option between selecting thumbs up, thumbs down or X. Still not sure which gets you into the game. The gameplay itself is fairly straight forward. You send souls to the right place with increasing complexity, in the same style as Papers, Please. although there doesnt seem to be any story involved besides, you are hungry and need the money. much like real life there. Ill update review if I actually get anywhere without accidently deleting the save in portugese. An OK game.If you liked Papers, Please, you might enjoy this game.However!A game that is this simple, and still manages to completely mess up the controls, is NOT a game I can recommend buying.ps. I noticed there has been some updates that fixes that controller issue, but at this time I have not checked it out yet, I will make a note to revisit this game. There is a bug that keeps causing the game to crash mid-level and despite multiple people reporting it and requesting something be done, the developer is no help and shows very little concern about the matter. While the game is interesting, it is impossible to play while this remains an issue and I cant recommend it for anyone. This game is complete and utter dog shitIt can be fun yes but trying to 100 complete it can suck a huge dickThey always reveal new features to either send someone to Heaven or Hell but never explain them correctly making you lose for no fucking reasonLike those stupid ass gun shots, I took off everything they had and they looked fine and send them to Heaven, but nope apparently they were suppose to go to Hell great fucking design.And other times they come out of fucking nowhereThere are always some stupid gimmicks like locking someone inside cages and making you lose time, how do you get rid of that happening? By using some in-game currency.Dont have enough currency? Well fuck you, you are stuck with the cages till you complete the levelsDont buy this if you wanna 100 complete this, only buy if you are just bored. Its a left or right clicker based on a criteria by each day. Gets boring REAL fast. Lowest common denominator Papers Please knock-off, that feels more like a disguised Flash game than anything else. But unlike the one it is cloning, it lacks all the tone, ambience, challenge and the emulation of anything. This completely hollow game plays as follows look at a character, either click on it to see if passes to purgatory or not, and do a grim reaper tinder matching game. Thats it. Well... that is, except the fucking telephone, the worst mechanic they could have implemented here, yes, what we really needed was a choice made through a boring paragraph of text to kill the momentum of each level.Also, the lazy memes and random topical and very out of date even at time of release famous persons are not comedy, its also not even edgy, its just the bottom pit of an excuse to pretend the Funny tag belongs here. A premisse without a punchline is just that, a half baked lazy premise, its neither funny nor a joke. Ive had more fun on phone games. Press left or right as fast as you can without messing up. YOU WIN BRAH GOOD JOB! First week Bam. Simple, fun game play without much difficulty, but potential I was liking itSecond week Well shit. The introduction of purgatory isnt hard, rather just unplayable. Characters with bloodweapons are meant to be sent to purgatory, but about half the time characters with blood or weapons give you faliure if you send them to purgatory instead of hell. Telling who you are meant to send to hell and purgatory is freakin impossible, the game very cryptically explains it, and fails to really show you what youre looking for. If you like casual mobile games, buy it. Game was visually brilliant, at least.",

        "text": "Fun and relaxing game. Always something to do and the updates keep it interesting. I am 72, have tried to play other games, but they cannot compete with Stardew, so I only play Stardew. Thank you, Concerned Ape. I play a lot of games you would call rage inducing. I love the hack and slash thrill from DMC, the gore fest from Doom Eternal, the unbearable challenges of Souls-Like games. My wife introduced me to this game and its a game I didnt know I needed. I deal with a lot of anxiety and PTSD from my military service and other stressors in my life, but theres something about harvesting crops and petting your duck named Howard that just feels so relaxing. This game is an escape from the everyday stress and I cant recommend it enough. And it was developed by a one man army?! Like damn this man earned his flowers. This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldnt find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. Ive put thousands of hours into Stardew Valley. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game. this game let me live my wildest sexual fantasies of having a job and someone who actually loves me This game lets me live my wildest sexual fantasies of having a job and someone who actually loves me I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didnt think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that hed started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.Last September he committed suicide.After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.And because of that, I cant help but smile whenever I play this game.I cannot recommend it enough every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable ill ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it, the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. Its hard to stop once I get invested in the game minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, were all just happy to be together. this game is dangerous i would recommend not playing it unless you want to be completely incapacitated for the first 2 weeks you own it One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldnt rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100 completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game thats just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over. If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Dont rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits. Stardew Valley feels like coming home.I cant remember which playthrough Im on, which is a rarity for me. Ive revisited childhood favorites like Zelda and Mario countless times, cherishing each experience. However, as an adult, this happens less frequently. Maybe its because modern games dont resonate with me as deeply, or maybe my gaming habits have simply changed over time. Yet, whenever I boot up Stardew Valley, it hits all the right notes. Whether Ive talked with the residents of Pelican Town dozens of times or played through its events repeatedly, the game retains its magical allure. It feels like a nostalgic return to childhood gaming, a comforting experience I can enjoy every time of the year.Whats truly remarkable is the developers commitment to continually expanding the game with substantial updates and expansions, all provided for free. Stardew Valley brims with passion and love. Despite its status as one of the most successful indie games of all time, the developer continues to pour his heart into it, enriching the experience for players. I deeply respect and appreciate this dedication, which unfortunately is no longer a given in todays gaming industry.And after all these years, Ive finally reached the summit . play this game with the characters wiki open because nothing will hurt more than putting all ur hard work into growing a cauliflower and then picking the person u like the most for this special gift and them just saying ew This game has been a great distraction since I lost my ability to walk. Sustained a work injury in January that leaves me permanently bedridden. Its so calming to build a farm and watch it thrive! I love the interactions with all the townfolk, and theres so many cool secrets in this game I cant even begin. Wish my wife couldve played this game with me There isnt much to be said that hasnt already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100 enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You wont want to quit, Just 1 more day then you realize that turned into 5 days and its 4am and you have to sleep sometime. This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npcs to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the games huge museum or use to upgrade your tools! I cant praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Dont wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!! If youre looking for a wholesome game that destroys your IRL health bar, look no further. The regularly satisfying hits of dopamine will cause addiction. Youll lose sleep due to the Just one more day factor. Youll strain your eyes. Your most visited website will change. The existential crisis that will awaken in you for enjoying a pixelated, 2-D world more than your reality will send you down a path of reflection and, in most cases, enlightenment. Probably. Fun and peaceful game. It never gets boring with all the additions. I am 58 and have tried to play other games but often get stressed out but I feel quite calm and relaxed playing Stardew Valley, it is better than all the others! Thank you. If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming? Well, its a lot easier than you think.Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw. Stardew Valley lets you live the millennial fantasy of having more than three friends in your twenties, owning property, and having a stable income. personally i found this game really enjoyable but i dont think Ive played enough to give a proper review just yet Stardew Valley is a very special game to me. It was one of the first games I ever played on steam. It helped to ground and distract me when I was going through depression and rough patches in my life. I think the charm of the game is its simplicity, beautiful music, relationships with villagers and cute animals. You just seem to slip through time and forget your worries. I used to play with a special person who became my best friend and rock, but we have drifted apart and dont talk anymore.

        "text": "A uniquely addictive game that I am surprised to say I didnt like. This is without a doubt a very high quality, excellent game, but if you are the kind of person that gets easily stressed out by a packed to-do list, this game might not be for you. I was constantly focusing on how to get to the next objective and the next. I think thats a strong suit for folks who want a game with a lot of challenges to overcome, but for me too stressful because time management matters in Stardew Valley. After an unexpected 55 hours of playing this game, Ive concluded that this game isnt for me. I wish Steam had a mixed option for reviews, but here we are.Theres a lot to love about this game. Its a calming experience that lets you relax as you slowly progress through the games systems. Many parts of the game are slow and deliberately tedious in a way that really makes you feel like youve truly earned what youve gotten. Its pretty satisfying.The game also continually opens up in a lot of unexpected ways. New features, new areas, a lot of new content is never shown to you until its unlocked. Once the game starts feeling a little stale, youll suddenly unlock a new item thatll greatly speed up your farm, or maybe an entirely new NPC will show up permanently. If I were to return to playing this game, itd be for this reason. I definitely havent seen everything the game has to offer.My problems with this game lies in my motivation for playing it. Stardew can be satisfying as you progress, but by no means do I find the gameplay enjoyable. The experience of actually farming, raising animals, mining and exploring caves, combat, fishing, its all very monotonous. This doesnt have the same genuinely enjoyable gameplay loop that other games share, although for some that might be fine since the tedium of the gameplay might make their accomplishments feel more impactful you spending all those hours building that farm is what gives the completed project meaning. For my tastes, all of that could have been okay, as long as there was some other, larger reason for me to keep playing besides gameplay.The characters of Stardew is what I find most disappointing theres very little meaningful social interactions between the player and the characters, besides scripted events. You can talk to characters exactly once per day, where theyll often be repeating the same routines and repeating the same dialogue. To further your relationship with them, you just give them gifts until they reach scripted social sequences that, frankly speaking, dont feel very authentic to me at all. You never really talk with these NPCs besides scripted sequences and events, everything else is just repeated dialogue. Its hard for me to believe that my character is supposed to have a relationship with another character when most of it consists of me one-sidedly handing gifts and then hanging out sometimes, and only once. These characters never felt realistic to me and its what killed my interest in playing, I could forgive monotonous gameplay if the characters, interactions, and general sense of community felt real.But this games very active community clearly loves the characters, so maybe its different for everyone. I think its still worth trying to see for yourself, but in my opinion this part of the game needs a significant overhaul and judging by how long its been, I dont think it will. oh hey yeah this games actually greatseeing as though there doesnt seem to be any risk of this game falling below the overwhelmingly positive review threshold, i wanted to draw attention to one particular issue this game has that i dont think gets talked about and may be important for some peopleThe social mechanic. Its garbage, and if youre coming from something like Animal Crossing where the characters are charming and full of personality then you are  going to be disappointed.  Almost every character adheres to some basic stereotype when you first meet them the goth girl, the homeless guy, the respectable mayor, the wine mom, and so on and so forth. The idea is that as you get to know them, they develop more and you learn theyve got more of a personality then you thought. Sounds interesting, right? But since this is a game were talking about, it begs the question, how do these relationships actually develop? Naturally through conversation? Shared activities? Parties? Other social events?Items. You shower them with items. Thats it. Thats the social mechanic people are so smitten with in this game, and I was a little let down when I discovered it really was that simple. The other main way to increase the heart score of the NPCs is to talk to them. Every day. As they repeat the same dialogue, in the same places, usually at the same time. The NPCs have routines, in the sense that a married NPC will stand in their locked kitchen for three hours every day before youre allowed to talk to them. Its about as robotic as a friendship mechanic could ever hope to be, and it makes the inhabitants of Stardew Valley come off as almost hilariously materialistic and shallow. Ah - and relationships degrade. If youre not drowning NPCs in items and small talk, theyll practically forget they ever met you. Mind you, if youre playing Stardew Valley, chances are youre the person restoring the community center, donating literally entire collections of minerals to the towns only museum, fulfilling countless individual villager requests, and providing food for everyone living there. All that, yet the residents of Stardew Valley will scarcely give you the time of day unless you remember all of their birthdays, give dozens of unsolicited gifts and dont you dare give them the  wrong  gifts - theyll get angry, and listen to them repeat the same dialogue lines hundreds of times a year. One of the implicit messages were supposed to take from Stardew Valley is the importance of small-town values over the corporate greed of Joja Corporation. The irony is the NPCs who occupy Stardew Valley are almost certainly more cynical, materialistic, and greedy than Joja is ever shown to be. Stardew Valley is the only example I have ever seen of the megacorporation actually being more sympathetic than ordinary townsfolk. BUT yeah the farming bit is funbuy the game I have to feel a little guilty writing a negative review for this game. In a lot of ways, its a real work of art - you have to appreciate that its the vision of a single developer who dreamed up the concept, coded the mechanics, wrote the dialogue, composed the music and designed the beautiful art of the game all on his own. This game undeniably has a really special charm to it, but here I am in the summer of my second year, with about 20 hours logged, and while I definitely dont regret purchasing the game, I cant bring myself to keep playing.First, the good. The masterfully done pixel art makes growing crops and filling out your farm a visually satisfying experience. Each season has its own distinct color palette, the character portraits are adorable, with dozens of different expressions for every character in town, and I especially like the way the world looks at night. Each season also has its own soundtrack, and though the developer is no Koji Kondo, the music he composed for the game is quality, better even than some game music written by dedicated composers, and theres a ton of it. The dialogue has a lot of character, the sound effects are great... everything about the experience that can be called creative or artistic is top notch. My issue with the game is more a problem of how it plays out.So, this game is tedious as all hell. Probably the most egregious example is the mines, the most game-y part of the game, where you go through caves, mine ores and gems, and slay monsters for loot. Think top-down Minecraft. I dont understand the need for this aspect of the game at all. I have no problem with the fantasy of it, swords and slimes co-existing with cubicles and TV sets - its just terribly boring. Its fun in Minecraft because you can shape the world and theres a real element of exploration, but here, its just exhausting. Combat in this game is about as basic as it can get, and advancing through the mines is pure chance - you keep breaking rocks until you get lucky and find the way down, which sometimes takes forever. The only challenge in it is making sure you come prepared, with enough home-grown food to get you through 5 levels of the mine shaft so you can get home, but so long as you do that, nothing bad can happen to you.Actually, nothing bad happens to you in this game at all. There is no such thing as a setback. Pests will never devour your crops. Your animals will never get sick, a fox will never steal into your chicken coop and make off with a chicken, you will never deal with droughts or floods. The game is a steady climb upward as your fields get wider and your barns get bigger. I wasnt expecting Rimworld, but the reason this game is tedious is that managing your farm isnt interesting work at all. There are no decisions to be made, really. Does is really matter what crop I grow, or whether I buy another goat or another cow instead? Just make sure everything is watered - your daily chore, running around your field irrigating with your little watering can, and youll be fine. There have been a few times where Ive stopped playing because I knew I would have to wake up and water everything again and I just couldnt be bothered. On the plus side, this leads to you praying for rainy days that will spare you that drudgery, just like a real farmer!Most disappointing is the social mechanic of the game, which, had it been better, would have been enough to redeem everything else on its own. A lot of the incentive to grow certain crops or acquire certain resources, ores, fish, wood, etc. is to gift them to the townsfolk so that they like you better. They ask for items from time to time, and once you figure out what they like, you can gift them things on a weekly basis, but I dont see a point to it all. For all the seeming emphasis placed on the various townsfolk, there isnt hardly any narrative to the game. The villagers will interact with you, but almost never with each other - you unlock events based on how much they like you, but theres no sense of real community in Pelican Town, and your actions dont really impact the town all that much. So, while there is a good amount of well-written dialogue, Im not too interested in putting in the time to help everyone out, since its basically just a matter of running around and giving people gifts twice a week. The lack of a really engaging story kills this aspect of the game. Theres a cast of fairly interesting characters, but as far as I can tell, they never get fleshed out. These people have known each other for how long? There should be decades of gossip, rivalries, bonds, history between everyone else that you, the newcomer, gradually get let in on, but so far, I havent seen much of that. It feels more like everyone else moved there right when you did.Lacking a good reason to deeply engage with the management of your farm, or the other characters in Stardew Valley, what were left with is ultimately a beautifully polished Farmville. I dont regret buying the game, or the hours that Ive put into it so far, but I cant see myself playing the game further. I will absolutely be keeping an eye out for ConcernedApes next project, though! I want to like this game, but I cant. Having played the games that Stardew Valley was based off of namely Harvest Moon and Rune Factory, I have lots of experience with the genre, and I very much enjoy these kinds of games.But I cant like this one. Heres why-None of the townspeople were interesting enough for me to like them.  Each NPC only has a line or two of dialogue per day, so I didnt feel motivated to go out and interact with them daily.-If you do like the NPCs, you will have a lot of trouble finding them. The NPCs do not show up on the map, they have unclear schedules, and you cannot enter their rooms until after you have reached Level Two friendship. I ended up standing outside a characters door for six in-game hours just so I could give him a birthday present.-The control scheme can be very clunky at times. The game operates on a grid-based system, and your character can only interact with the 8 tiles surrounding them. You cannot interact with a tile that is more than one block away, and you also cannot interact with the tile that your character is standing on.-There are a large number of bugs that still havent been fixed despite the game having been out for two years. Sometimes your spouse, children, and pets will get stuck in the wall. Despite completing the quest to unlock an area, I was unable to enter it because I couldnt interact with the NPC that blocks your path. In the Museum inspired by Animal Crossing I repeatedly got stuck in the edit mode and had to restart my computer, losing an entire day of progress.-There is no way to manually save your game. The only way to save your game is to go to sleep and proceed to the next day. The game does not tell you this even when you use the in-game menu to exit the game, you are not told that your progress will be lost. Furthermore, you only have one save slot, so all decisions you make are permanent unless you want to repeat the entire day. -I had to install multiple mods to improve my quality of life while playing, in particular a tooltip that lets you know what a planted crop is and a map that shows NPC locations. I also had to manually edit my save file because you cannot change what bonuses you receive from reaching certain skill levels.-Its a relatively minor nitpick, but your character moves very slowly. After playing Rune Factory 4, Stardew Valley feels sluggish even when riding a horse.Of course, most of the things I have a problem with might not bother you. In fact, theres a very good chance that youll enjoy this game. If a big update to fix some of these bugs and add some much-needed features was released, I would have a much more enjoyable time playing it. But until then, Im going back to Rune Factory 4. Although this game is kind of good with its concept, graphics, characters, and Joja Corporation, I didnt have as much fun as I expected. I bought this game because somebody told me this could be a good stress relief game, but ironically it did the complete opposite for me. It was very stressful because I have to do the things I want to within 22 minutes 1 in-game day before falling asleep, which causes me to lose money. In this low-stress game I had to rush EVERYTHING, which causes a lot of stress.I manage to complete the story part of the game in 5 in-game months, 1 year and 1 month in-game and everything got repetetive from there Grind, sell, run to bed. Shop, grind, sell, run to bed. Pointless holiday, walk to bed with no items to sell. Grind, sell, run to bed.The characters do feel like soulless animatronics after a while to the point of ignoring them, due to their predictable dialogue and where they will walk to next and when.But my favorite thing in the entire game is Joja Corporation, just having a realistic villain company threatening corporate takeover of the town, and leaves room to your imaginaton to what the corporation is like.Well thats my experience with this game, this game is clearly not designed for me, but I play it from time to time. But if you grew up with the Harvest Moon series, this game might be for you. Im not stopping you from playing, I just want to tell my experience with this game. Who knows? you might like this game, unlike me. I know this is a controversial negative review as everybody seems to love this game, and that my review wont even make a dent in the sea of overwhelmingly positive reviews, but I personally really didnt enjoy Stardew Valley.Its repetitive, with little reward and nothing much to aim for. The social system relies on you grinding for gifts to reach favour with the npcs, along with this not much is explained to you in the beginning. Also, the days are short and cause you to rush to get everything done so you dont lose money. I can agree that Stardew Valley definitely has character, and a nice art style, but if Im going to devote my time and spend my money on a game that I can only compliment through its art style, then its not worth the effort. Ive played games like this, and ones that are very similar to this, so I know for sure that I can enjoy the genre, but for me, I found Stardew didnt meet my expectations or fit any of the high praise I had heard.EDIT Let me just eat my words and say Stardew Valley is, in fact, enjoyable - BUT, my point still stands in that, had I not been playing my most recent game in coop, I still wouldve found it incredibly draining. Im just lucky to have a friend who enjoys farming whilst I go and fart about in the caves all day - because farming is absolutely necessary to the game, stardew is repetitive, and I only actually like one or two aspects of the game, and had I been forced to do everything in singleplayer? My opinion of this game would absolutely still stand, so I am going to leave this as a negative review. I have tried playing this game before when it first came out and I didnt understand it so I really disliked it. Now that 1.1 has come out I decided to give it another go, about 50 hours later I have mixed feeling and really wish I didnt. For a game made by a single person or a small group of people it is inspiring. It is well made and shows that this is a project crafted in love. That said, it has this feeling of a void that cannot be filled. Something is missing from this game and I am not sure what that thing is. Is it the lack of end game progression or meaningful skills? Is it the constant grind? Or the push to be more efficient all the time? I am not sure.Stardew Valley lands in this place of trying to tell a story without forcing it on the player. Which sounds great on paper, but it just falls short in my opinion. The connection to the towns people is superficial and my immersion to the game as this city-folk turned farmer broke as the game went further and further into the late game. The townspeople felt less like friendly faces I want to get to know and more like obstacles. I just disliked the people and the temptation to just get the Jojo Mart to demolish the community center became more and more appealing. And after finding out what the ending is for the major storyline, I said to myself is that it? While the game can be played forever, the main story arch falls flat and I feel no meaningful connection to it. For the amount of effort and time put into the game, I just dont personally feel a sense of accomplishment. Only one character in the game seems to achieve somethings and its not you, its some other character. This feeling is made even worse with the lack of a personal connection made to the towns people I really could care less. And even after 50 hours of putting into the title, I am going to stop playing the game for right now.I would say I enjoyed the early game the most, the mystery of the game, but hated the story line, the connection to the townspeople and the late game grind and lack of meaningful skills or items. I guess I answered my earlier question. I am going to rate this as a negative review solely because a mixed review gets lost in the sea of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.In my opinion, I think this game is highly overrated, but that does not mean its a horrible game or a bad game. I think it has the potential to be a good game, but for right now I think its just an okay game. It has a great initial experience, but as the game progress it gets worse and worse. In all honesty and despite the Overwhelmingly Positive reviews here on Steam, I found myself constantly bored in Stardew Valley. I will admit, however, that the concept is appealing to A LOT of people, but I am not one of them. I thought I would because I am such a fan of Terraria, but I learned from this game that positive reviews do not necessarily mean a game is your cup of tea. This game is like crack cocaine I literally cannot stop playing it no matter how hard I try. If everyone in Africa played this game the starvation issue would be solved because this game has removed my need to eat, all I must do is give Abigail amethyst. leaving a negative review untill the relatively new and persistant multiplayer disconnect issue is resolved.  this game worked perfectly fine with multiplayer for years and then suddenly in the past year or so no one can remain connected to a lobby I host.  I see this issue  on numerous threads with no solution, supposedly a time out issue the devs need to correct so the server refreshes instead of kicking people.  I have tried every fix i have found over the past year or so and nothing works.  I love this game but this is a seriously ignored issue that needs to be fixed. im sure this game is great when you really get into it unfortunately, i just cant. time-based mechanics are very stressfull for me, and my impression is that stardew valley has a LOT of those. how could i possibly feel relaxed when i have to remember to water the crops, talk to everyone in town, figure out what gifts they like, and check out whatever seasonal thing is going on at the moment, every single day, and find whatever i need for the community center?! if i want a game to relax to, i boot up celeste, because a having a simple, predictable wall to repeatedly mash your face against is relaxing to me. evidently though, a lot of people arent like me. but if you are, stay clear of this game Ive been sitting on this review for a while, not quite certain why I never found this game fun when its issues are not as blatantly obvious as some titles. Being reminded of my grievances with the game thanks to discussing it with friends, I think I better understand why, despite my many efforts, I could never fully share in others love of this title.Theres a lot thats charming about this game, dont get me wrong. The graphics for one are cute and adorable, as is the art for the characters that gives them all their own unique flair, the music is catchy as Hell, and mechanically, everything works as intended. On the surface it looks like an okay game, and thats something Id even agree with despite not being able to recommend it. And yet, how theyre integrated and the amount of guesswork, schedule making, or wiki searching necessary to understand said mechanics is part of the problem. Simply put, there is just not enough to do that feels legitimately rewarding, making the mechanics really shine through as just that. Mechanics. I cant escape into the slow, relaxed, and cozy feelings this game was trying to encourage because there was always several mechanics I needed to keep track of in order to progress in the game. If I didnt and attempted to take it at my own pace as the game suggests, Id end up missing out on opportunities and even being suddenly pushed back in my progress. I dont mind a little trial and error, but the fact several mechanics employ this technique while providing no way to know this besides failing, or looking them up, often lead to an experience that had me feeling overwhelmed or too directionless to be entertained. The game has six main mechanics that Ill be discussing farming, animal care, mining, fishing, socializing, and curfew, for the sake of my review. Farming is pretty basic most of the time. You use your hoe to till the dirt, plant the seeds of whatever is in season and then wait for them to grow. Yep, thats it. Besides watering them everyday, some in-game fertilizers you can use, and potentially having to worry about birds, for a farming sim, Stardew Valley doesnt offer much to do in this regard, in my opinion. Most of it comes down to picking the crops and deciding whether you want to sell them, save them, or add them to the community center to complete a collection. You can maintain it in other ways, such as creating paths and so on and so forth, but I found these were too easily destroyed over time to actively bother. Either way, each choice would be a way to progress your farm in some way, and if youre not doing that or finished one of those mechanics, youre forced to look for work elsewhere.Animal Care You buy an animal, put them in a barn, give them hay and...thats it. You wait for them to give you products or potentially farm them yourselves, like with milk, and decided to either sell, keep, or add them to the community center to complete a collection. Are you noticing a theme yet? The grind comes with collecting the material and money for each of the buildings needed for an animal. After that, youre left to find yet something else to do instead, as a players interaction with these are few and far between.Mining This is probably my favorite mechanic simply because it is actively rewarding and offers more variety. You both have to mine and fight the creatures you encounter, each level having its own unique resources and monsters. The monsters in turn give their own resources you can use or sell for a considerable amount considering how much you might pick up. Each set of levels are visually appealing in their own way and offer new challenges and better equipment along the way. Considering how much stone and iron is used for buildings and equipment, this is the easiest way to collect most of the materials required in game. Energy and health must be maintained while doing so. If this was the main mechanic, Id love the game.Fishing The most bare bones mechanic despite it usually being my favorite in other titles. You play a mini game in which you catch the fish or you dont, you sell the fish or you keep it. In some playthroughs I dont even touch this mechanic at all unless I am desperate for the money, and even still, the mini game can be so frustrating I usually give it up the moment other systems sail off.Socializing This is my least favorite element of the game, and its unfortunate because all the characters have potential. In a town that could be given so much life, the villagers are mostly summed down to a few cliche lines, special events dont usually offer much in the way of understanding them on a deeper level, and ones relationship with them falls down to whether they talk to them every day and give them two gifts every week. Gifts in which villagers will have a dramatic reaction to if they dont like it, and came off as extremely shallow because of that, and the fact theyll practically forget you if you dont go through the pain of talking to them almost every day. Even worse, they expect you to do this while also having their own schedules one either has to memorize or look up to find them at any given time, and this schedule can change depending on the day and season. Because some of them run the shops, this means some shops were made only accessible within uncomfortably short time periods. I had to closely follow a guide for this one and wouldnt have been able to marry any of the characters otherwise. Even then it didnt feel like an achievement. I might as well be married to a stack of cardboard that randomly hated me.Curfew This is the most annoying mechanic that will stop players in their tracks. No matter how much energy you have, at a certain time you will be forced to go to sleep for the night, otherwise you will pass out and drop some of what you are carrying. I dont understand the intent with this at all, and it was a constant pain in my butt throughout. It usually just forced you to walk back to your farm and then back to wherever you were to complete whatever you were focusing on moments prior. I dont know why this was implemented when there was already an energy system that did much the same thing.I am aware cooking is a mechanic, but didnt mention it because I was never given much incentive to invest in it. So I am not mentioning it here for the time being. Quests also were usually too much of a pain for me to bother.As one can see with all these mechanics, youre either progressing one of these systems or you are left to do absolutely nothing but twiddle your thumbs. When you do finish them, theres not enough to do with the finished products to feel rewarded. I found no reason to be slow and relaxed about my playthroughs, because there was just nothing there for me to be slow and relaxed about. Everything felt empty, requiring a grind or to wait. I think this is why games like Animal Crossing work for me and Stardew Valley does not. In Animal Crossing, there is a lot of a variety with a very clear line between more official tasks such as housestore renovations and the museum and tasks that could be done purely for the sake of ones enjoyment without expectations talking to villagers, buying clothes or furniture for decoration, animal collection. And even then, theres plenty of ways to enjoy the world without necessarily being pressured to lean on every mechanic. Animal Crossing gives you a break, Stardew Valley does not.My point being, I think its very impressive that such a small development team created this game, but I wouldnt really recommend this for players looking for a more casual and relaxed experience. If you like keeping track of schedules and resources, youll probably enjoy this game and Id recommend it! But if youd want something thats cute and might focus more on the potential social aspects like me, then I wouldnt recommend it. The reviews made this game sound like a slam-dunk of a purchase, though it really let me down. The gameplay isnt all that entertaining, the townspeople have about the same depth as Pokemon Blues NPCs, and the rapid progression of days doesnt leave much time to both improve your farm and engage with the rest of the world. Its a clever concept that just doesnt reach what it aims to be. Clearly a large number of people dont agree with me given the overwhelmingly positive reviews this game has. Perhaps I was just the wrong player for it. This game is too addicting youll play it for weeks at a time then quit and relapse like a addict. Wasnt for me, if you can really get into Minecraft or have a GF obsessed with it ,you will have a good time.the day to day busy work didnt stimulate my brain but it definitely suits a lot of people.Give it a try and hope you end up enjoying it more than me. Me and my friend cant join together after continuous retries. it keeps failing to connect us to the games, despite trying everything google has told us to do, we each have tried to disable firewalls and antivirus and have the exact same version of the game, but it still bugs out and we cant play the game together Stardew is a game that can suck you in with its monotony. I find it strange I have sunk over 60 hours in this game. Perhaps the art stlye with its cutehomey atmosphere distracted me.I love that each NPC is fleshed out and has their own daily routine. Friendships can lead to love, which in turn may blossom to marriage and a family. I appreciate that Stardew takes into account gender for romance, your character can fall in love with whomever you decide. The main objective is to repair the Community Center and forge lasting friendships with everyone. Whilst exploring the respective mines, uncovering the hidden secrets and artifacts throughout the valley.Now for my personal grievances.It takes way too long for you to actually notice progress. Not to spoil but an NPC will inform you that once a year from the first, youll unlock things for each season one....year...at...a...time. I am not sure how much time it takes for a year in game to pass, maybe 8-10 hours if you play dedicatedly. It boggles my mind how much time you have to invest to see anything change.Oh my goodness, is it too much to ask to tell me how much exp I have or am gaining? Its like being told something is going to happen, but no idea when or where. In essence pure frustration. It will take new players 2 or so years to repair the first room of the Community Center. By the time they realize they need season specific ingredients, spring will have passed and summer is on its way out.The skill tree is misleading. At lvl 5 you will unlock 2 perks, one shitty the other decent. Then at lvl 10 the shitty perk lets you upgrade to overpowered perks, while the other upgrades to useless. Once you make your choice it is locked in for that play through, so your bad choice will stay and come back to bite you in late game.One thing I cannot stand is the exhaustion, it really pissed me off. It is an idiotic mechanic that so many games are plagued with, its sole purpose is to stop you from doing too much to soon. Which lessens your interest in playing a game that limits you so.Your daily engagement include but are not limited to watering, collecting, talking, gifting, fishing, mining, fighting, digging, delivering, foraging and farming. All of which is permitted within 20 hours, whereby a good chunk of that is eaten by daily chores. I just got sick to death of the same thing everyday, tend to animals, harvest occasionally, talk to ppl, forage or fish or mine, then back home or collapse at 200 am. I think a fast forward button would have been a huge help. When the game itself feels like a chore, then you know to put it down and maybe not come back. Buy the game if you want a farming sim that struggles with mundanity and little replay value. I know this is gonna be disliked, so treat this as a Mixed review, but Ill get to that.First, the goodStardew Valley is a cute little farming sim set in the small hamlet of Pelican Town. It is atmospheric and immersive, with well written characters that certainly feel real.The music is great and fits perfectly with the current theme of the game, cheery and bright music for Spring and Summer, and calm and tranquil music for Autumn and Winter. Each romanceable character also has their own theme that plays during their relationship events, which can certainly aid you in falling in love with the character.The pixelated art style makes the game feel cozy and relaxing, provided you can tell what youre looking at.But thats about where my praises end, now the badThe beginning of the game is a slog, confusing, and directionless. I have countless saves that didnt make it past the first in game week from losing motivation to continue playing within a couple hours, then never playing again for months before coming back and starting again.There is no sense of purpose and the game doesnt show you what is supposed to be your goal until you are hours in, the Community Centre, but that itself provides little to actually do at the start, once you add everything you can from this season you cant do much beyond wait until the next season.The mechanics of the game are poorly explained with the in game tutorial ending at two boxes at the side of the screen telling you how to walk. You are never even told how to buy crops, and how each crop differs from each other, for example.The game requires you to have the community made wiki open on a second monitor almost at all times, destroying any immersion it had, as the game never tells you where different fish are located, or what gifts a character likes, unless you are willing to spend many hours trying to do trial and error, and writing down the outcome of it for future reference, which is obviously a lot more difficult than just opening the wiki.The in game day is hardcoded to end at 2 am, causing you to pass out, and if youre anywhere but your farm, youll have items and money stolen from you, but again this isnt told to the player until theyve experienced it once, which can lead to you feeling cheated as some valuable items are deleted without warning. The closest the game comes to telling you is a Its getting late. popup which to a new player wouldnt mean much.This time limit can also lead to you wanting to maximise the most out of every day, so you dont miss something important that wont come back until next year, which can quickly lead to burn out as the game becomes more work than game. I have seen people say just dont play that way and just relax. which is ok advice but I know some people, such as myself, that wont be able to rest if theyre not constantly doing everything needed, which leads me to my final point.This game is not for everyone, most games arent, but on the question of Do you recommend this game? to a player new to gaming or just the average player in general? No, this game is very niche despite the very vocal playerbase. I could only recommend this game to someone with experience with the Harvest Moon style, who already knows what to expect, or someone with a strong resilience to the poor new player experience and motivation to get through to the second year, where, despite my hatred for this saying, Id say the game truly begins. Lewis keeps sending me mail asking for Naughty feet pics not sure if this is a glitch, but It has disrupted my game play immensely.",
        "summary": "Stardew can be satisfying as you progress, but by no means do I find the gameplay enjoyable. The experience of actually farming, raising animals, mining and exploring caves, combat, fishing, its all very monotonous. There are very little meaningful social interactions between the player and the characters, besides scripted events."

Great game very fun. Wish it had workshop support for custom games  characters Really fun game with friends, BUT I wish they add more things that could make the game better. For example 1. Emotes that you can do, more intractable things to do ingame like smoke, drink beer, sigar ect.2. Face emotes - ability to change face expressions.3. Hand emotes like showing f-u finger, and more. 4. Stand up from chair and go to bar so you can buy the things like cigar, beer, drinks ect.5. More gamemodes so it dosent get to repetitive. 6. more characters u can choose from. 7. different maps.8. Add this game to VR.But a good game after all. If the devs want this game to survive 1 month, theyll fix the Host leaving issue. Its literally a dead game otherwise. Salty 12 yr olds leave as soon as they are out and of they are host the game stops. FUN GAME BUT WHEN LOBBY HOST LOSES AND DECIDES TO LEAVE MOSTLY HAPPENS YOUR GAME SESSION WILL BE TERMINATED AND YOU WONT BE REWARDED FOR THE EFFORTS EVEN IF YOU WERE EADING HE GAME FIX THAT PLEASE AND THANKS Fun Game but should punnish bad losers closing the game after winning, I won 4 games and lost all my experience because of the host of the room closed the game. PS Get rid of the japanese giraffes theyre annoying af This game is amazing, i play it with randoms because my friends dont play games and it brings me tons of joy.PS If you hosted the game, be fair and wait until the end, do not leave. that was great , just need voice in lobby and in game random position , more characters and spector mode and if the game can have more than 4 play , i think it will be more enjoyable Its exciting to watch a pig frantically move its head around as it stares down the barrel of the revolver praying that theres no round loaded. 1010 would gamble again While the game itself is enjoyable, there is a recurring issue when joining lobbies hosted by other players. Often, if the host dies early in the game, they will abandon the server, which effectively ruins the experience for everyone else. This is a significant problem that undermines the overall enjoyment of the game.To address this, a penalty system should be introduced to discourage such behavior. Hosts who prematurely leave the game should face consequences, ensuring a more consistent and fair experience for all players. I like it so far. Excited for more games, especially poker.One thing that would be cool would be if in liars deck, if someone calls your bluff, and you are not bluffing. That you have the opportunity to point your gun at someone and click. Just an idea. This game is really fun. Fix lobby system and remove chat censor and its a perfectly serviceable game. Its lacking in some content right now but its still really fun.Also change the rhinos voice its soo baaadReally excited for pokerEdit Somehow they outdid themselves and made the red pandas voice even worse than the rhinos. Those two voices straight up make every match less enjoyable. Recommend the dev team to hire some people on Fiverr or some other service  to source some human voices over the current low grade AI generated ones. Would help with the atmosphere. Maybe take inspiration from Poker Night at the Inventory WPT online and have some background interactions with the barkeep to bring things to the table. Overall a fun time with friends but good luck getting into a game with randoms and not getting kicked immediately. Oh a completely fantastic drinking game when you dont wanna leave the comfort of your home but want the excitement of high-stakes betting with friends on discord. I will be THOROUGHLY enjoying this with friends over night time weekend chats, drunk beyond belief, and even into old age when we are all split apart due to life man. Great concept thats well executed in a nicely made environment. This is a game of times.This is an honest tableIts an aces table.plays an aceother player plays 2 acesother player plays 2 acesother player plays 1 aceplays 2 acesother player plays 1 aceother player plays 1 aceother player plays 1 aceWell, I got no aces left, so I have to use the other mechanic. LIAR. The previous player played an ace. First shot is a bullet. I died because the rest of the table was being honest. this game is incredibly fun. however i think spectators should be unable to see the remaining players hands as it could lead to cheating, otherwise all praise the zootopia spinoff this may dethrone space marine for GOTY its fun until you hear AI voices... I hope they get their shit together and get some real VA before version one. I think this game is tons of fun, especially with friends, and would love to see them progress the game into something akin to a full party game with various modes. HOWEVER, now that the game has gotten vastly popular, it would be incredible to see them go back and update the AI voices with real talents. The AI usage is the one thing Im not a fan of with the game, and it would be great to support creators though having them voice the characters in the game! I love taking the rabbit character and constantly looking at watermelons. 1010 game...Thank you for your point gifts, I needed them For an early access game, Liars Bar is well on its way to release. I enjoy Liars Bar, and recommend playing LB in its current state.PROs 1. Audibles. Voice chat makes this game all about table talk. If you want a quiet table full of cool cats, you can find one. If you want a table where people accuse each other of lying even when its not their turn to call LIAR, those exist. If you want a hostile table full of people that assault each other with profanity and insults, you can find those too. Verbally act out your game character like a tabletop RPG? You can do that with voice chat.2. Non-verbals. Move camera angle to shake your head yes or no. Text chat helps bridge language barriers and mics muted due to bad background noise. Want to shrug but no emotion coded yet? Just paste     into chat. Text chat is just big enough to accept haiku poems, and blocks out profanity words. Your voice doesnt match the character you play? Playing in a room with players that speak another language? Paste lines into text chat.3. Learning? LB has a BASIC dice mode and a BASIC deck mode. I suggest you learn BASIC modes before others. Community member Sampo provides a guide to rules for all modes httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id3377103757CONs1. Heat. Overuse of GPUs may take several actions to correct. In an actual game, press ESC, then clicking Settings Display and setting Max FPS to 60 is usually most helpful. Some players have to install a utility like the shareware FPSMon to monitor their heat, then leave a lobby between games to not crash or hang. Sometimes when my processors get hot, the Random Number Generator RNG starts to hate me. See my crash management guide for details httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id33998196982. Vandals. Cheaters and cheesers can steal a win or break a game. Cheaters created at least three publicly available cheat mods for LB. Cheesers can exploit bugs to kill a player or hang a table. LB team is coding anti-cheat and reporting features to control cheatingcheesing over time. For now, the best defense is to find players you like to play with in the LB lobbies. For other options, see httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id34105945833. The third major issue is getting kicked from lobbies when you join. This usually happens when a lobby host is waiting for specific people, or when you dont match the requirements the host advertises in the lobby name. This happens most when I use the Quick Join feature and end up in a table for a language I dont speak. On rare occasion, I offended someone through a past mis-understanding and end up in their lobby, only to be kicked.Ive asked for enhancements to prevent fast lobby kicks, but feature requests are exactly that, requests. The devs probably are pretty focused on covering the other issues. If the following enhancements make sense to you, please add 1 replies to these posts.

        "text": "Its a great game with a great immersive aspect to it. Great game for friends to get together and shoot the shit with eachother.However... I cannot recommend that you play this game from a public lobby with randoms. Hackers run rampant and are allowed to look at your cards, connect to your PC, change the odds, change their own cards, the list goes on.Buyer beware right now -- the game is very insecure and the P2P networking model allows anyone to have a connection to your PC. Fun game but when lobby host loses and decides to leave Mostly happens, Your game session will be terminated and you wont be rewarded for the efforts even if you were leading the game. Cheaters. Thats why.And thats what sucks this is actually a really fun game, good enough to have crappy knock-offs on the playstation store... its just ruined by the playerbase. Ive had some really fun matches with super cool people, doing mind games, mixing lies and truths, trying to get into peoples heads. When played how its meant to be played, this game offers a really fun experience. However, you cant go 30 minutes without running into a cheater. They completely ruin the experience. They can see what cards you have, what cards you put down, modify the bullets in their gun, and more. Its just sooooooo crappy. The worst part is that the devs dont even seem to care. They KNOW this is an issue, yet they do nothing to stop it. I feel like they have the we already got paid mentality and its tragic. I do want to like this game, but its just not any fun now that it has been flooded with cheaters. They ruined a genuinely fun game. Game is fun but theres rampant cheating, Players that download the Hacks lets them change their cards, your cards, see what card is placed down, and can change where your bullet is loaded ensuring you die the instant your called a liar, this game seems to not have any anti-cheat system as well, This game will likely die out if the devs dont grab a hold of the steering wheel on this ship. I like this game, I think its cool. Id love to see it succeed!I leave a negative review so that it is hopefully more likely to be seen by the devs so they get constructive criticism that is much needed.1. The host leaving issue is bad, game killing bad. This needs to be fixed before anything else. Transfer of host will be likely the easiest fix.2. Performance issues. This game has zero right to be this poorly optimized. It is a single room. idc if its early access its ridiculous and every single pc should be able to handle a game like this. Also capping FPS in game would be a good start.3. The voice acting is done by AI and its bad. Take the thousands youve likely already made and find some cheap voice actors to record the lines you have better and add more lines. This games aesthetic is a powerful tool and VA is a huge part of it.4. At the end of a match there needs to be an option to vote to replay right away. The game wastes a lot of time menuing and waiting to ready up when its unnecessary.5. This game needs voice chat in lobbies, this would make people less likely to leave as soon as they die and make the experience with randoms more fun. Its hard to have a matchmaking Social game when you cant talk to the people your supposed to be social with. also no talking after death as maybe a toggle would be funny too.Now onto some smaller things that Id like to see but arent nearly as important.1. Let lobby makes choose between arsenic or roulette as the win condition since some people like the randomness and some do not.2.  Liars dice has multiple rule sets. Let people pick them. There are some that let 1s be wildcards and some that let you follow a number with less dice as long as the total is higher... for example if someone says 3 3s, this adds up to 9 and someone could follow that up with 2 5s since that totals 10. It makes the game have more strategy and replayability.3. Let us gamble, I think some sort of wager match system would be unique and fun. Just give a daily allowance that builds passively for opening the game This would also boost active player numbers on steam then allow wager match lobbies that use that instead of the deaths, This currency could then be spent on exclusive wager customization options like cosmetics or songs It might be worth having 2 currencies, one you receive and ones you win and only let players spend the ones they win in random lobbies or something to prevent hoarding and fear of losing it... this isnt a perfect solution since players likely just want to play with their friends and not randoms so you might need to return a smaller amount when playing private lobbies or something to prevent mass transfers between 2 parties.Overall I really hope this game succeeds. They should look to similar games like prominance poker to see what they did right and what they did wrong and learn from it. Fun game but people ruin the experience i would not buy unless you have 3 other friends to play with. besides the buggy matchmaking which i expect will be fixed eventually the main issue is the players. first off hosts will leave the game as soon as they die and you will get kicked. im talking spend 10 minutes and be 1 hand away from winning they die and everything is just erased unless this is changed i cant recommend this game. also people cheat. public games need to be with random people. not friends sitting in discord telling each other exactly what they have and never calling BS on one another. its very obvious. all that being said when you get in an actual lobby where everyone is talking and the host doesnt leave its great. Hope these issues can be addressed. Games fun! especially with friends, but if you play with randoms and the host loses, he usually just quits and the game ends instantly, not fun for anyone. most innovative my fucking ass. its a digital remake of a classic game thats been around for centuries and made as cheaply and easily as possible. use of Ai will tell you all you need to know Posting on January 2nd that soon there will be poker in the game, its now march 6th and no update and radio silence. I have never seen so many CHEATERS in one game, a skilled player, a guy with software. Razraby, maybe do something with the anti-cheat, instead of new modes? A new character came out, no anti-cheat, cool. Until there is a normal anti-cheat, I do not recommend wasting your hard-earned money under any circumstances. Lets bring the review to the top so that it gets noticed and the game gets better. Im enjoying the gameplay but very turned off by the AI voices. As the game progresses through and out of early access, I hope they replace those with actual voice actors. Id love to look forward to having more fun in this game but I dont think thats gonna be in the cards if the AI stays in. Liars Bar is characterless cash grab streamer bait game made with AI. Presumably people gave this the innovative gameplay award ironically, because its just dudoliars dice with online multiplayer.If you want a review of the classic game of Liars dice, then its a pretty fun game to play with friends. Calling peoples bluffs, getting away with lying and the increasing bets are entertaining enough, despite the simplicity of the game. Theres fun to be had, Liars Bar is just poor execution. How the fuck did this win most innovative gameplay? Its not a terrible game, but its just a variation on a game that has been around since literally the 15th century. The fact that its made with bad AI voices and who knows what other AI content doesnt help matters, either. The Russian roulette gimmick wears thin pretty quickly, too. Unoptimized, Chat GPT description which make no sense, the tooltips are nonsensical, the characters look like shovelware and the game is a buggy mess. They made this as cheaply as possible. ATTENTION TO STREAMERSDO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ATM. There is a huge security flaw where in Friends Only lobbies people can hack into your game and spam racist words, loud music, etc. It happened to me today and makes this game unplayable for streamers. Please fix ASAP devs. Match making is riddled with cheaters. Makes the game very pointless to say the least.. Not to mention not even hiring real voice actors.. With the amount of money theyve made of the game now.. they could easily afford to hire for the work. Disappointing. Fun game play but shitty AI slop voices.Im shocked that this is considered for a steam game award or whatever its called with so much low quality AI dog shitonly play with friends cuz normal matchmaking games have more cheaters than CS until they get voice actors, im calling this a.i. slop. they dont seem to care about it since all theyve been doing is releasing new characters. not to mention as of this reviews initial post, they still havent released the lizard guy and are still working on poker. It has potential! but I spend to much time looking for lobby than the actual game play. Thats because when the host is loosing he just quit and disband the lobby. Sad, It so much fun when it works, sadly it doesnt. I dont even wanna talk about the cheater..... games fun if you find the right lobby but right now its quite unplayable1. if lobby maker left the game end instantly, not granting any win count or level2. Cheaters, cheaters already running rampant, and theyre not even trying to hide. Instant pass if you played the right card, instant call if you bluff. Hell theres even a room in simplified chinese advertising the hack at lobby list. I dont expect dev who have not much resources are going to fix it soon, so dont buy it unless you got 3 more friend to play with",

Sorry, folks!I enjoyed it, but found it in parts a bit difficult. Its a great mix of brain-teaser and dexterity game, embedded in a plot you unveil during the game.You will spend a great deal of the game playing an increasingly difficult series of levels where you must jump over obstacles and shoot enemies in a 2D setting, going automatically from left to right. So if you enjoyed the Bit.Trip.Runner games you will enjoy this.Length of the game 2-4 hours for 100 percent.Recommended When on sale for 2.50 or less. The less you know about this game, the better experience you will have. Its unlike any game i have ever played. This game tries to mess with your mind. And its pretty good at that. It makes you wanna beat it so hard, because if you dont, your soul will be lost forever. Buy it, sacrifice a cute innocent puppy and enjoy this exceptional game! Pony Island is a B. I came here after playing Inscryption and watching a Lets Play, which really isnt the best way to experience a Daniel Mullins game, but its been long enough that the secrets are long since out. Even knowing what I was in for, its an excellent mind-screw of a couple different genres. It can be beaten in just around two hours if just care about the plot and not the 100 run. I really like it.The thing Ive noticed about Inscryption and Pony Island is that Daniel Mullins WANTS you to beat the game. During the action scenes of Pony Island, you get plenty of subtle help if you die. For example, if you keep dying by falling onto gates, the gates VISUALLY stay the same but their HITBOXES get a little skinnier. Enemy attacks are the same way, where if you die to several projectiles, they might need to hit more than just your little pony rump in order to register as a hit. There are no direct Difficulty Levels per se, but its clear Mullins wants gamers of all skill levels to be able to experience his story. Respect.Inscrpytion made me a Daniel Mullins fan, and Pony Island just solidifies it. Now to play The Hex! Pony Island is an interesting game.Levels are a bit repetitive at first.Eventually you get powerups.After that, it gets more interesting.Some of the levels get pretty tricky.Early on, all you can do is jump.Hovering is added a bit later.Enemies come at you every few seconds.Leap over obstacles with left click.Push enemies away with right click.Make it to the flagpole and you can advance.Every so often you get a Puzzle BreakIts kind of like a programming puzzle.A butterfly is trying to get to its house.Moving arrows around defines a route.The butterfly follows the arrows.Reach the house to advance.Anybody can learn this game.Please give it a try.Play it right now.E  verybody.D331335 Yes, this is a skill issue. Yes, my skill issue. But the reason I mostly play narrative horror games is because Im NOT GOOD at fast moving jumpy shooty games, and Im going to have to DNF this one because the game-in-game is simply too hard for me. Its a shame, because I loved Inscryption, Im intrigued by this plot and I really loved the puzzle segments! But I dont love them enough to keep trying to grind this out.Steam makes me pick so Im hitting Recommend, since its my own fault I got less than halfway in. But the honest answer is that I dont recommend this but I dont not recommend it, either. But it would be nice to have some kind of escape hatch from the jumpy shooty parts, I guess. Coming from Inscryption which is from the same dev I was expecting something similar or meta but its just a game aboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesjustagameaboutponiesj Pony Island is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible, just know the game is about a couple hours long to beat normally, theres hidden collectibles that unlock the true ending, the base gameplay is a Runner-type of game with a few twists, and it plays with the idea of game development.Now slight spoilers ahead, but Ill try to avoid any major spoilers, just things you could figure out from the first 30 minutes of play.The idea of a corrupted video game is not an original idea at this point, but this may be the best its been executed thus far. Pony Island has you playing a corrupted Runner-type game starring a Pony, and the game at various points wants you to stop to Insert Your Soul, to continue in some way. The game is extremely meta in a number of ways, and is more about breaking the game than completing said tasks... Though breaking the game comes in a multitude of types, some feeling more natural, others more from a series of mechanics. Outside of the Runner Gameplay, the game mixes itself up quite often, with the most common mix-up being these puzzle type of scenarios that are supposed to represent programming where a key goes down a list with variable-changing stats, you need to get to a certain stat to unlock Red block gates, and you do this by inserting commands into blank slots to perform some sort of function. It sounds complicated on paper, but the game paces these extremely well so that theyre simple to understand at first and slowly build on themselves.Theres a story here that develops, and one difference in this game compared to many other corruption type games is its narrative angle. We seem to be playing some guy playing a cursed arcade machine, his 3D hands sometimes pop-up on the screen and sometimes we break off of the arcade screen to see glimpses of the world off the screen. Theres another soul trapped in the game trying to help us out to make sure we dont meet the same fate, and we get a direct line of communication with the maker of the game who is updating the game based off of our playtesting, and gets mad when we cheat at his game and, dont play how it was intended. The game is never scary, just sometimes a bit creepy and also has a good sense of humor, as well as some semi-commentary on aspects of game design, including authors intent and gratification they look for when making games, which I havent seen explored really in any other game Ive played.Its a fun ride, sometimes challenging, tricky to get the true ending without a guide, but an experience worth taking I would say. The gameplay is fun most of the time in all of its different forms, theres many twists and turns along the way, the narrative is nice backdrop to everything else, and the game successfully may catch you off-guard multiple times during its course. Probably the best realized attempt at a corrupted game to this point in time, and even outside of that, a fairly fun multi-layered experience in its own right. Pony Island is a devilishly charming video game that puts a refreshing spin on the videogame possessed-by-the-devil trope. While the gameplay may lack depth, it compensates with its unique aesthetic, tantalizing secrets, and delightfully offbeat tone. All you have to do is interact with shady interfaces, play silly java-style games and solve easy puzzles.The game purposefully leaves many mysteries unsolved, inviting fans to speculate and connect the dots themselves. Its a very short adventure, lacking in replayability, but completionists will be rewarded handsomely.Overall, Pony Island offers a pleasant ride filled with its own distinct flavor, even if it doesnt delve too deeply. Daniel Mullins, I wasnt familiar with your game. An utterly bonkers, dark and twisted puzzle adventure that is meta af. For my money, one of the best indies Ive ever played and I havent even finished it yet. Id be sure to check out Mullins other two games ASAP after this. Bravo. This is one of those games where you shouldnt even be reading reviews - just go in blind. Expect a weird and wacky journey.I will say this however There is a specific part of this game that I absolutely loved - it was a really clever, devious, and hilarious trick -- and sure enough, it accomplished its intended goal. I felt like such a dunce... it got me hook, line, and sinker. If you know, you know. I have no idea what the f I played, but it was awesome. Genius developers. 1110 would buy again any day. Almost fell for those fake Steam messages and the fake Pony Island doesnt react pop-up. Almost replied to a friend. Hilarious. Never saw such things in any game before. You gotta love Indie games and the creativity of its developers. Ive gotten more and more jaded with the indulgent indie meta stuff. Its unstoppable and inevitable. But even with my tired, weeping eyes, and between the sobs begging indie games to just be a real game and stop fooling around with the fourth and fifth and seventeenth wall, there are good games.Pony Island manages to bring life to this dead horse. When I first bought the game, i was pretty unsure about the tag horror that was attached to the game category because im easily scared. I still took a chance.Oh god I wasnt deceived at ALL! This game is truly amazing !! Such an original concept, very interesting story. gameplay is super fun as well! I had a great time and I was super happy that there wasnt any jumpscares or stuff like that! It was spooky because you didnt know what was going on, which is, in my own opinion, much scarier than any jumpscares!I recommend this game for sure !! D Pony Island is a platformpuzzle game with a great story of the lovehate relationship between a player and a developer. Expect 4th wall breaking, best enjoyed to go in blind and enjoy the ride. It has secrets to explore and a special ending for the perfectionists. It contains themes of satan and devils for comedic purposes so avoid the game if that triggers you.For achievement huntersThere are collectibles, missables and a chapter select after you beat the game. If youre reading this review stop, scroll up, dont read any more reviews, dont watch the trailer or read about the game, just buy it and play it and dont stop playing until you finish the game. Trust me, youll be glad you did. Im reasonably sure I didnt sell my soul here. But theres definitely room for doubt. This game leaves me with a lot of existential doubt, actually. How do I know if any of the other games Ive played werent written by Satan?I dont doubt it was money well-spent, and an absolute bargain at 67 off in the Halloween Sale. Warning Minor spoilers!It has been a while since a game has had me wtfing all over the place, but Pony Island brought it back to life. This game is genius.Storyline Basic breakdown is that you are trapped within some funky arcade machine that has gone vicious thanks to the devil himself deciding to be a programmer. Take the cover of the game.. Take what you expect the game to be and throw them out the window. Already as you begin, its clear that something isnt right - Having to fix a broken and glicthy menu from the get go before youre able to commence the gameplay is a sign that the devil may not be as good of a programmer as he likes to think.As the cursed player of this hellish demon-game, you get whisked around from a chaotic, glitchy, broken world to a cutesey, diabetes-inducing pastel nightmare, with random logic puzzles thrown in, to fix Satans buggy code. As you guide your pony through the devils glitchy game, you can catch brief glimpses of who your character used to be before they were killed and trapped in the game. The story is gritty, blurred and as twisty as the day is long. Basically, its fantastic. Gameplay I feels as though I had to make an extra section just for gameplay because its honestly that damn good. The ingenuity of the puzzles, the level designs and the text communication alone make it note worthy. Pony Island as a whole is magnificent and shows incredibly unique ideas put together insanely well. When something like this, running on such simple mechanics can set an atmosphere so well, it raises the bar for many other games to do the same.Also! Passcodes to keep tucked away until needed Baphomet and 2023 Graphics The look of it makes it feel like a genuine ported arcade game. Its pixely, its box-like, its all kinds of good while been fairly simplistic.Menus Broken because of Satan.Soundtrack This goes from being an eerie and abrasive glitchy, retro, electronic style base for the tension and horror-ish atmosphere and then completely flips a coin to be colorful, cute and innocent with its uncomfortably cheerful electronic notes. The changes in this set the scene and is yet another thing that makes this game so unique, its unlike anything youve heard before.Final Conclusion Get this. Seriously. Its rare that games can really spice things up with something new. With that been said, unique ideas are one thing, but its the fact that they are brought together well that makes Pony Island stand above the rest. It keeps you thinking, provides great atmosphere, keeps you on your toes and has so much hidden content perfect for those willing to look for it.",
        "summary": "The controls are really tight, too- the mouse-only take on jumping and blowing away butterflies is great if youre in the same boat as me and sacrificed your keyboard and soul to the glorious Lord Satan. A really enjoyable experience, definitely a ten out of tSOMEBODY HELP ME BEFO."

        "text": "This is the first Overwhelmingly Positive game that I have ever felt did not deserve the title. The game is only interesting on a very superficial level for all of its meta-ness. The actual gameplay is extremely boring. For a 2 hour game, it is repetetive and simplistic to a fault. 90 of the game is doing the same thing over and over running in a very simplistic platformer with frustrating gimicks. 10 of the game is decent logic puzzles, but because they are thrown at you, its hard to really enjoy them for what they are. The entire game is a railroad, and because the puzzles are not hard, and few and far between, much of the game is spent doing nothing but waiting for rather unfunny text to scroll by.The game is tied together in a really simplistic and annoying narrative, with text that moves soooo sloowwwwllllyyy and you cannot fast forward. The Lucifer666 stuff is over the top to the point where it seems childish and hamfisted, rather than being creepy, spooky, or even interesting at all.  More like a middle school kids idea of a joke.It wasnt a horrible game, but it was by no means a good game. The best I can say about it is that it was mildly interesting, but not enough to warrant the high scores and positive reviews. I dont think its worth the 5 price tag. Even at a cheaper price, though, it still wouldnt be enjoyable. The chromatic aberration effect is very strong with no way to reduce it. It hurts my eyes after 15 of playing it. Seems fun, shame that accessibility was not considered at all. I cannot recommend this game. To me, the whole fun about a game like this is the reveal of the meta game. This game lacks all subtlety. It goes right into the meta game without any real game there in the first place to get you interested. The writing is overt and crude. It lacks personality and there is nothing there to give it any weight. The story feels contrived and there is nothing to attach you to the game or the world. Its just stuff happening.If you can get it on sale for a few bucks it is OK to pass an hour two but I am incredibly surprised to see this compared to games like Undertale. I am usually very easily impressed by games like this one. But this one just isnt it. The puzzles were annoying and were really disconnected from the overall game. The story is not enjoyable. Gameplay is repetitive and you get this feeling of dread every time you see a pony running. I was really excited to play this game, because Daniel Mullins is an amazing game developer. The Hex is one of my favorite games of all time. But Pony Island is simply a promise unfulfilled. I dont recommend this game. Even though it is cheap and doesnt take much time to complete, you are still better off playing something else. A few bucks for a few hours of ponies. Its hard to complain about price, so I wont. And to respect all the other reviewers who want you to go in blind, Ill keep this as vague as I can.I think the dev learned a lot of valuable lessons from this game in his following games. And Im super interested in pony island 2 to see how he reintegrates those lessons back into this IP. But the gameplay loop in this one is pretty rough, and the most interesting sections are over quickly. Those other games Im hinting towards are much better, and you should skip straight to those instead of letting this be your first experience with the kinds of games this dude likes making.And if youre hungry for more after those games, you can come back here and ignore everything Im saying. Monotonous and too satanic for me to enjoy it, makes it distasteful. Its trying to be edgy and scary but the gameplay becomes extremely repetitive after 15 minutes, the puzzles are incredibly easy once you get the hang of it and its not worth it, I get that the help me I am trapped in a game premise is interesting, but Doki Doki Literature Club made it far more engaging than this crap being only a point and click. Much more interesting than enjoyable. Its a game worth playing for people interested in video game design because of its play with metalanguage like any other Mullins game.A very original and creative debut with many different ideas, but with one major issue for me and others that despite being so short, the puzzles of placing pieces are a real pain and they take away quite a bit of the charm of the game and your enjoyement.  510 I picked this up on the steam end of year sale due to the glowing reviews.  After playing through all of it, I really dont understand the overwhelmingly positive ratings for this game.  There was definitely some clever fourth wall breaking, but clever doesnt save it from its own attempts to be edgy with regards to religious iconongraphyreferences.  A little subtlety would have gone a LONG way there - it left it feeling rather childish, and not in a good way.But outside of this, lets look at this in the context of being a game.  I will likely never replay this game - and thats not something I say lightly, especially for one that attempts to mess with the player.  There have been plenty of games that have thrown in twists while you are playing that subvert the initial experiences with the game, or reach out and talk to the player that are not only replayable, but are MORE interesting after playing through.  This is not one of those games - it becomes clear pretty quickly what you are getting into, and it is no more interesting for having finished it.Without spoiling, The Asmodeus thing is where I will give credit - it was very well executed, and was probably the only genuine surprise in the game.  But after that -- what is left?  There is no freedom in this game.  There are no round-about solutions, despite the fact that its presented as otherwise.  Everything is very very straight forward, with no room for variance from one play to the next.Honestly, at the price I paid on sale - about 75 off of list - its maybe OK.  I felt compelled to see the whole thing through, but thats only because I am a completionist, and this was so hyped as overwhelmingly positive.  If it wasnt for the hype, I wouldnt have bothered.  I described it in another comment as feeling like a newgrounds game circa 1998 or so, and I still am hard pressed to come up with a better description.Dont expect anything ground breaking, and dont expect anything fun.  Expect forced glitches and lots of satan references with an occasional dash of clever. I really dont understand the hype behind this game. Really cool concept, dont get me wrong, but its been done before and better.I love the whole corrupted, evil game concept, but here its held down by almost offensively boring gameplay.Plus, the story falls flat in the end, so the one good thing the game has going for it isnt done well.You are much better off just watching a playthrough, youd get roughly the same experience. NO spoilers in this review. The final recommendation I give is negative partially because of the expectations I have towards games that have such a good review score. It does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong, starting with the best ones The main idea of the game is really nice Well written humor and timing, I often enjoyed the dialogue very much Some clever puzzles and amazing game elements for sureThe things listed above may already be good enough reasons to try the game out during a sale and see for yourself if you like the game or not, after all the game has overwhelmingly positive overall reviews and on top of that its cheap as hell. And because of these big selling points I dont regret buying and playing and not refunding the game either. But here come the negatives there were some big ones for me unfortunately- As a completionist I wouldve preferred a written way to continue the achievementstory hunting after reaching an ending instead of just a scene selection. This is where I got really disconnected and had to decide whether it was worth it to go through it again manually, and after several days of battling it I decided it was not even though the urge to get 100 is strong in me.- Why did I decide it wasnt worth it to continue to the final ending? Because of the biggest problem of the whole game both the puzzles and action scenes got really tedious during the first playthrough already and this is something Id imagine happens to most players. Most of the puzzles dont take too much wit to solve and the action is easy, both just take a lot of time anyway. And Id have to go through some of those again just to get the rest of the content? No thanks, sorry - The main plot for me was predictable going into any of it would be spoilers so I wont- I checked the Internet to see if I was wrong to stop playing when I did, and unfortunately I was not both gameplay- and plotwise. Finding all of the collectibles to get to 100 completion wouldve been way too hard and not in the good way youd want from a puzzle game, but in the way that some of them were hidden behind completely random things. Youll find some of those naturally while playing, some by accident and a couple because youre smart, but many of them youd have to find through either a pure luck, b checking a guide on the Internet or c wasting TONS of time looking for them manually.Because of these negatives I stopped playing the game before I wouldve really wanted to, so I cant recommend it without a warning. However, Id still tell a stranger to give it a chance and just refund it if after 2 hours you find that it wasnt for you, because after 2 hours youll know. And even though the review is negative, the game is still an impressive opening by the developers, I hope you continue on the path of making games in the future. I liked the concept of the game, but there were several things ruining the experience for me The game is really heavy on text dialogs and its as hard and frustrating to read as it ever gets- I need to follow text messages in a terminal, which are continuously appearing and moving the text randomly. I cant read a randomly jumping text- Sometimes there are two dialogs going on at the same time, where both disappear as they finish. Its impossible to follow both especially if one of them is the terminal from before- There are shaking effects added to the text sometimes Sound effects hurt my ears while wearing headphones these 8bit sounds are really sharp The base games is only fun at the beginning both the puzzles and the jumping game. By the end I was just waiting for them to end finally. It was an ok experience but seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I thought I had to balance it out. If you have played Inscryption already, there is not much point in playing Pony Island as it is essentially the same game in spirit, with Pony Island being more of a bare bone prototype in comparison.  If youre looking for something like Undertale, no this is not it either.  Pony Island builds a game around the idea of being meta, instead of adding a meta layer to existing developed gameplay and narrative.  If you take away the meta, there is no plot and there is no game.  I am sure the devs are aware of this as well, and Inscryption is their answer to it.  Just play Inscryption. To whover compared this game to The Stanley Parable, The Beginners Guide... you are out of your mind.The game is not bad, but I dont get what all the hype around this thing is about. Nothing special about it. Just some decent puzzles, that are not specially challenging. And a story line that is just OK. Fun until i tried to remap the controls. Now I cannot set anything to mouse buttons, nor can I reset to default controls. Fun gamer, but my digital copy is funcionally broken. Not good! It is actually one of the very few games I regret playing.This might sound a bit harsh, but hear me out. The core idea of this game is decent enough, but the gameplay was bland and the story was not interesting. I was so bored after only 30min! Since I always give games a fair chance and I knew this was a short game, I did a full playthrough anyway.So what specifically didnt I like? Well, lets take a look- Platforming  Was ok in the very start, but I quickly became tired of it. It is so incredibly barebone basic. I didnt expect a regular platformer game, but I was hoping for a little more depth. Mid-game this also became frustrating and annoying. Like it was trying to make things hard for you, but not in a good challenging way.- Puzzles  Actually somewhat original and I liked that it was represented as code well, kinda, however... the puzzle mechanics were clunky and there were just too much of the same thing, so I quickly lost interest.- Conversations  Watching text slowly being typed on the screen while listening to the annoying typing sound effect. - Story  Didnt care for it. Boring and very forgettable. It only managed to capture my attention the first 30min. or so.On the positive side, there was this one little thing later in the game that startled me real good. Im not going to spoil anything, since it sadly was the best thing in the whole game.Conclusion  The game was neither fun, scary or interesting. It was just slow, bland and annoying. This had a few really clever moments, and youll know them when you see them, but a majority of the game is spent playing the game-within-a-game, also called Pony Island, which in all of its iterations is incredibly boring. You could argue that that was the point, but as a game it makes it very dull.Theres a lot of wasted potential at the start I felt uneasy doing anything in the game, but instead of keeping that psychological horror going, it very quickly turns into a very hammy battle against a moustache-twirling villain the story itself felt little more than an attempt to be subversive, too - ponies are cute, right? what if they..... werent?. The puzzles are very simplistic, really not living up to the liberty of the meta form.It was a decent enough two hours, but doesnt provide anything you wont get from a flash game, and is absolutely a case of wasted potential. Its different, sure. While the story is kinda interesting, you can miss it for the most part. And event though it took less than three hours to complete, the gameplay gets too repetitive and boring for my taste. Pony Island is actually two games in one, which alternate repeatedly  an experimental puzzle game a very basic side-scrolling arcade gameThe experimental puzzle gameThis is where Pony Island shines and where it got its reputation and high review scores from. The parts of the game where youre puzzling are indeed great. The puzzles are simple yet they feel original, and they yield a sense of accomplishment when you solve them. The only downside would be that graphically, the puzzles look like a game from the 1980s. But if you can live with that, the puzzling aspect of Pony Island is worth playing.The very basic side-scrolling arcade gameThis is the part of Pony Island that is frustrating and repetitive. A side-scrolling arcade game isnt the most loved game genre of this day and age, and Pony Island brings a very basic version of such an arcade game to boot  gameplay is repetitive and uninspired jump, shoot and avoid the foes who only come in 2 varieties, nothing more. Even 30 years ago, games like that had more content e.g. boosts and power ups, variety of foes, variety of backgrounds, a health bar, ... Here you get the raw model of all those games, stripped of anything that would make it stand out at least a bit. graphics are in the same ballpark as the puzzles, so circa 1985. Think Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 style, although those consoles offered more variety in sprites and more colour in general. The story ?I didnt really expect a lot of story in Pony Island. After all, it is not a story-driven game. But since quite a few of the reviewers here praise the storytelling, I feel a word of warning is in place there is no story beyond what the product page and the basic premise of the game already tells you You are in limbo, trapped in a malevolent and malfunctioning arcade machine devised by the devil himself. Besides that, in the game you meet a demon who can answer a few basic questions about the character you play Who was I?, When did I die?, Where did I die? Who killed me? The answers to those questions dont make for a lot of reading either, at about 15 words each. E.g. dont expect a whole background story when you ask Who was I? you just get a first name and the fact that you had a wife and daughter. Full stop. And the same goes for each of the questions.So when people praise Pony Island because it has a great story, I frown. And I wonder what the reason for statements like that could be. Did they get caught up in their enthousiasm over the experimental and pleasant puzzling aspect of this game? Nothing wrong with that, of course, but I do feel I have to be clear about this for people who arent sure whether to buy this game there isnt really a story to this game besides the basic premise. The verdict a red thumb down? No way!Yes way. The question before me is Do you recommend this game?. Well, before I bought Pony Island I just went by the general verdict of overwhelmingly positive and a quick glance at some reviews praising the originality of the puzzling aspect of this game, and I bought it. If only I had searched for some negative reviews that warned me about the tediousness of the arcade aspect -and almost all of them do!- I would have been better off. Sure, I would have missed out on a pleasant puzzling experience, but lets not overhype it it isnt that genre-changing. And visually, its unappealing. On the other hand, those reviews would have saved me a lot of frustrating and tedious moments when trying to get through the arcade parts of this game, which I could have really done without. So I hope this negative review finds its way to someone whos not sure whether to buy Pony Island or not, and it helps that person to make the decision that is right for him or her, be it to buy or not to buy.A word about the Steam-related stuffPony Island has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are nicely done, combining some obvious ones with some hard-to-find ones and even a few difficult ones. The good thing is, after youve finished the game you can use a menu option to jump to one of the main points of the game, so you dont have to replay the whole game if you missed an achievement or two along the way. Found it more frustrating than fun. I was so interested in the story but dahm man... I dunno, maybe Im the one missing something here, but this game was not interesting or clever at all.Maybe theres like a super secret ending that makes everything worthwhile, but I really did not get anything out of this game.",

After playing this for a week straight my dreams are full of card suits and just me discarding deck after deck.. Only play this if youre prepared to not do anything else for a few days. Just one more hand...  This is the  CIV of card games.100 hour update  Ive seen things you people wouldnt believe. Multipliers on fire after picking Purple Stake difficulty. I watched jokers glitter in the dark near the Ante 16 boss. All those moments will be lost in time, like cards in a deck.Time to fold...170 hour update Im now in Balatro remission.. Stay safe kids, its highly addictive! This game is actually addictive. I know that term gets thrown around a lot, but have you ever seen those videos of old people just wasting away their lives at a slot machine in a casino? Thats me. Thats me playing Balatro. I intentionally avoided this game because1. I never cared to playunderstand poker.2. I dont like gambling.Everything I heard about this game made me want to play it less.I was wrong.This game is simple, elegant, addictive, endlessly replayable, and barely has anything to do with actual poker. Its a simple game where you do the following1. Play card hands to increase your score. Beat a levels specific score to win the level and earn money. The game lists the card hands you can play in a menu that you can reference any time.2. Spend winnings on upgrades and new cards which make winning future levels easier.Thats it. Once it clicks, this game becomes as quintessential as Tetris. From a person who was initially skeptical about playing Balatro, I highly recommend it. A man walks into a casino and goes to the poker table. He pulls out a tarot card, a ripped up joker, and a picture of a bus. The poker deck suddenly only has aces of hearts. He earns more chips than there are atoms in the known universe. He walks out the casino and cashes out for 5 dollars.Changing this review. After many hours in the game, I have come to the conclusion that it should instead sayA man walks into a casino and goes to the poker table. He pulls out a tarot card, picture of a king, and picture of a mime. The poker deck suddenly only has kings of diamonds made out of SOLID STEEL and some made out of SOLID GOLD, earning him 3 dollars each, stamped with a red wax seal and made shiny. He earns more chips than there are atoms in the known observable universe. He cashes out for 5 dollars and walks on out. Dont buy this game, unless youre okay with becoming consumed by an obsession you dont even understand. I blinked and 35 hours went by in 3 days... Send help. i have played a lot of games, for a long time. many different genres, design sensiblities, and art styles, across several decades, on so many different systems. from NetHack to Hades II, from SpaceChem to Cookie Clicker, from DOOM 1993 to DOOM 2016.this, for my money, might be the best game ever made.intuitively simple exquisitely complex and deep. i have every achievement and still cannot see a future where i dont play this anymore. arguably, this video games existence is a testament to the undying creativity of the human spirit --- that we make works of dear significance and utter perfection almost by accident simply by following those pursuits we enjoy most.furthermore, here i am, inspired to write all this pseudopoetic drivel about a video game next to meme reviews by accounts pretending to be Goku or whatever. but i wouldnt be sitting here calling it the best game ever made if it didnt also drive me to write the undying creativity of the human spirit in a steam reviewjust buy it, and buy it again for whatever other platforms you have. its really good It is unreal how this games soundtrack consists of ONE track, and in 70 hours of playing I never got tired of it. In fact, every time I boot up the game I get excited to hear the song again. it is absurd how good this game is. sure, for the extremely well designed mechanics themselves, but almost every review says that. for me, im just kinda in awe of how perfect the minor details are. the sound effects are punchy and satisfying, the cards sway when you mouse over them, special cards shimmer and sparkle, beating a boss blind has a special chime, all the way down to how beating a round by a huge margin gives you this crazy fire effect on the score. its a game made by someone who totally understands how to make something feel good. and thats awesome.

Bala Bala Bala Ball Ba BA bBbbbbb Balatro.  ConclusionBuy Balatro. in 1989, Tetris was released for the NES. It is commonly regarded as one of the best puzzle games of all time due to its precise design and carefully considered gameplay. It has no fat on it to trim and the fluff was never there to begin with. It needed no balance patches, and to go along with it, that one, continuous song that became etched into the minds of a generation. It was a real life Polybius, and many people called it the perfect game.35 years later, Balatro was released.Balatro is a special kind of game. Its a game where the success of the player isnt determined by how fast they can act, like tetris, how precise their inputs, like mario, or even how much they know, like pokemon. Its instead about how they use their head to navigate simple systems that play off each other perfectly. A player need not even tab out of the game to access all the information about what could appear in the shop, what cards they might draw, or how much their hand may score. But theres ambiguity there, theres uncertainty. Its the ability to have enough control and information to make an informed decision, like chess, but enough randomness to bring additional excitement that is absent in games with less ambiguity. And so you sit at your computer, hitting that reset shop button, eyes glued to the screen, waiting for that one piece so that your build can all fall into place. 50 gold becomes 45. 45 becomes 39. 32. 25. This next shop needs the card you want if you want to be able to afford it. You hover your mouse over the reroll button. The one, infectious melody playing over and over in your head. And youve travelled back to 1989, youre sitting on the carpet too close to the screen in your pyjamas, its past your bedtime. Boom. Tetris.It might be 35 years until we get another game quite like Balatro. But Ill keep on watching that number go up, keep on listening to that song, keep on saying one more go until we do. Addicted? Im not addicted. Ive been gambling for 20 years. The shaking is due to the excitement of getting to gamble more.buy the game, its good The negative reviews say the game sucks because its too RNG dependent. 4 hours in I agreed with them, 5 more and I couldnt disagree more. Play this game. Balatro is an amazing roguelike game. I personally never enjoyed poker, but fell in love with Balatro, so if youre in a similar boat put the poker elements aside and think of it as a deck-building game. You have a 52 card deck which can be shaped in a variety of ways. There are 150 joker cards with unique effects that impact your run, planet cards which increase the power of poker hands, and arcane cards which typically allow you to enhance, alter, or remove cards from your deck. There are eight antes, or levels, in a Balatro run your goal is to complete ante eight. Each ante has three different rounds, the first two can be skipped to recieve a benefit however youll miss out on the cash and item shop you wouldve earned from playing the round the last one is a boss round where a specific modifier is applied to you heart cards debuffed, face cards drawn face down, only one hand type, etc. After each round you get access to an item shop where you can purchase jokers, or cards which will improve your deck - you also gain interest on money held between rounds in-case nothing in the shop catches your eye. These elements all work together well to create a fun experience where every decision matters, that is unique each run, and always winnable on lower difficulties once you get the hang of it. One of my favorite things about Balatro is how much variety there is. With 150 jokers and 15 deck choices, there are many different strategies you can build into while finding success. As an example, I recently won only playing clubs, only playing two pair, playing high card, and playing only face cards. In terms of criticisms for Balatro, while it is really well balanced around lower difficulties, once youre at the highest difficulty levels that doesnt hold true. IMO this is something thats way harder to balance in a deckbuilder, but in other popular amazing roguelikes, Hades, and The Binding of Isaac you could throw a really high skill player into some of the highest difficulty settingschallenges available, and their skill could carry them to victory, and over a 50 win rate. In Balatro on the other hand, you can play absolutely perfectly, and never see anything good in the shop before the round scale to a point where youre going to lose. I dont claim to be an amazing Balatro player, but I can guarantee you that even the best Balatro player in the world, or a bot doing everything perfectly, is going to have a very low win rate with the black deck on gold stakes. Another small point of criticismfeedback is joker balance while most have amazing use cases, there are a few that feel worthless moreso than ones that feel OP or super strong.Another massive win for Balatro is that the solo developer, LocalThunk, is clearly very passionate, talented, and receptive to feedback from the community. Since Ive been playing there have been multiple patches balancing jokers, difficulty levels, card modifications, etc. even though I do have a few criticisms for Balatro, they dont make me think negatively about the game in any way because I know LocalThunk is listening to the community, and is going to continue doing an amazing job with the game the only thing I dislike about LocalThunk is that he created that Completionist achievement. Balatro is a game I was skeptical to pick up because of my dislike for poker, but now I have 200 hours in the game, have completed all 20 challenges, and beat the hardest difficulty on 1115 decks clearly, I am very high on the game. Balatro is also an amazing entry point for the roguelike genre. Its a game that is so unique, adapting many of the genres best elements to a classic game in impressive fashion, on top of that its incredibly polished and charming Balatro is a game anyone can enjoy, and its an instant entry into the pantheon of all-time amazing roguelike games. Necessary PlayIf you found my review helpful, please consider following my Steam Curator page, where you can see more thoughts and recommendations NOMINATE THIS FOR GAME OF THE YEAR!Everything in this game is designed for maximum dopamine emittance - and if real money was involved, this would need to be outlawed and shunned immediately before it would certainly ruin countless lives. Because if people can get so heavily addicted to the mere simple thrill of all the usual little games that are on offer in the familiar usual places, then this would assuredly cause catastrophe a new kind of pandemic would sweep the globe, and this is merely Version 1.00. One shudders at the thought of the ways in which it might evolve, with it being so elegantly designed already. So brutally effective, yet innocently charming on the surface a simple game about scoring poker hands in a vaguely retro veneer.So play a hand then, and pray to your deity or your dog that it doesnt consume your life whole. Heed the warning, for there might be a time in your life before Balatro, yet there might not might be a time after it because youll be too busy grinding away for it to be a life anymore. Go on and play a hand, and then play another, and keep on going until you either finish the run - maybe just about, and youll be proud for a moment before trying your hand at the next difficulty, the next stake and oh boy can this be tough, but you wont be defeated by a little game about poker hands, will you? Or if you went sailing through to Ante 8, the endless awaits - and there are a rare few things in life as precious and as beautiful a balance like organically finding or luckily stumbling into a strategy that can stay head to head for a while, until the exponential will do as it does and leave you in the dust.Whatever you do, youll fail sooner or later, and then just like in death, a grand nothing awaits for all your efforts - nothing, but the time spent, the life lived, the game played, the knowledge gained. The ol platitude is true the goal lies in the journey, the act doing, the act of living. So thats what you do you wont stare at the main menu screen for long - because life awaits and in death you can rest - so, cue up another run, another go, another attempt, - and laugh in the face of the reaper because in this here world, youre alive and your journey hasnt ended, and youre in control after all. Live it all up, laugh it all up - laugh against the dying of the light, become a jester, a joker, the nightmare of all mighty beings that only ever deal in absolutes, in finalities, that are all too serious to consider the truest truth a human can know lifes a big bad joke and then you die, no punchline and no point - well, that is, ironically, besides the laugh, cause thats what a joke is for. A joke, like a laugh, can only make sense, can only be of worth to the living - and this game is decidedly more than just a bad joke its a hearty belly-laugh of a game, its one of those rare things that you can never get enough of, that keeps you alive, that youll think and dream about when youre not playing it and that you can never wait to get back to - for just another quick try.And after all that, if youre still with me its such a simple concept, so reduced in scope compared to the grand collective works that pepper the gaming landscape, and yet, curiously, it is also a superlative in every way, its poker turned to 11 and good luck getting to ante 11, before the first time it feels impossible. Its such a simple game conceptually, it has no right, it is ourageous for it to be this good, this addicting, this satisfying in all the right ways. Its teasing your brain, always egging you on to really think through every. single. hand that you play - and yet it lends itself so easily to a sporadic, intuitive style that follows the flow of the given run. It is truly elegant, the way in which it achieves this balance.This feels like if someone manufactured by hand a perfect marble sphere look at it and be impressed at the labour and commitment, the attention to detail, and marvel at the technical talent to achieve it - yet, be completely unable to grasp the extent of the work, the time, the passion and all the frustration, that went into it. It is deceptively beautiful - like all true works of art and strokes of genius that one might call themselves lucky to encounter in their life.This might seem like too high of a praise but I am not joking when I say that this rivals true classics like chess or tetris. This is a game that perfectly knows what it wants to be and incomprehensibly somehow achieves it on every single level. It is truly absurd. It feels like it shouldnt be possible and I am all the happier that it is and that this game exists.TLDR - if you like deck-building rogue lites this is a rare 1010 - and if you dont know what a deck-building rogue lite is then there is no better way than to start here. The price of admission is low and worth every cent. I went into this game knowing nothing about poker and came out of it becoming addicted to Balatro. You dont need to know much about poker to do well in this game, as the game is pretty simple when you first start out until you unlock more jokers and find new builds to run. I can spend hours on this game without even realizing how much time has gone by. Definitely recommend! Just need to beat one run. Just need to unlock these decks. Just need to beat this stake. Just need to beat a run with every deck. Just need to try one challenge run. Just need to beat gold stakes. Just need to unlock this Joker. Just need to complete this achievement.Dangerously close to uninstalling this game because I cant do much else. I wont. Im at 95 unlocks and I just need to hit 100 on unlocks.Its fantastic. A Great Take on the GenreWhy did I wait so long to play this? What more can I say about a game thats already highly praised? Balatro is a fantastic twist on the deck-building genre, combining strategy, creativity, and a touch of luck to deliver an exciting and addictive experience. GameplayEach run feels unique, yet at times the randomness can be frustrating, particularly if you get a bad draw early on and it ruins an otherwise promising run. It kinda lies a lot at RNG, but I cant complain about that in a poker game I guess. It may also take time for the game to clearly teach the mechanics to newbies. However, once internalized, the game becomes very enjoyable.  With its endless combinations and unpredictable runs, Balatro has excellent replay value. Art and SoundBalatros simple yet charming art style is great. It has top notch UI design and looks very simple and clear from the players eyes.The sound design is delightful, with satisfying effects, though the music could use more variety to avoid feeling repetitive during long sessions.  The Major Issue with BalatroThe biggest issue with Balatro is how poorly the game teaches itself. The game is very easy to learn for beginners. But to play like a master and beat the game with harder challenges, its not enough. For example the game never teaches you that you could move jokers and explain how their order works. Same with the cards in hand. Its a very important nuance in high-level gameplay. I spent so many hours without knowing this. ConclusionBalatro is a clever and highly replayable game that breathes fresh air into the deck-building genre. It deserves the GOTY nomination for sure, but not the award itself. Still, great game.GOLDEN MEDALFollow My Curator Page Its like gambling except I dont spend money and want to off myself afterwords. On that note PEGI YOU DUMB ASS You should feel ashamed of yourselves for giving this a mature rating when you let children buy loot boxes. Tbh I dont care that you gave this game a mature rating, I care that you dont give games with actual gambling loot boxesgacha requiring REAL MONEY mature ratings AND think its OK for kids to partake in them. The companies that make those games are the ones fueling gambling addictions with their predatory deplorable behavior. I know way too many people that have spent north of 5k on loot boxes. Redeem yourselves and give those games a mature rating  fight for legislation to outright ban loot boxes  gacha mechanics for kids games ya idiots. You disgust me.Outstanding game, number go up, dopamine get released. Anyways chief, Im off to buy some crypto, hasta la wego. It is a rainy Saturday afternoon in early 2002 and I am barely 3 years old. I sit atop my fathers knee, watching as he plays the version of Spider Solitaire that came pre-installed on the family computer. I watch cards move across the screen and stack on top of each other as they make a satisfying sound akin to a deck of cards being shuffled. Some twenty-odd years and dozens of different card games played later and I now have Balatro, a game whose developer names Solitaire as its most important inspiration. Its almost as if Balatro was made for me... is what I would say if I had a delusional level of self-importance.The aim of Balatro is simple play a combination of poker hands in order to score enough points to meet an ever-increasing threshold each round. The reward for beating a round is some  and the chance to shop for packs, tarot cards, planet cards, and the famous Jokers which you can purchase to empower your run. Each run is comprised of 8 levels or Antes each with ending with a Boss Blind, a high scoring round with an additional  stipulation such as all heart cards are de-buffed. This all culminates in one final boss blind that you must complete to win the run. From there, you can keep going in endless mode to get high scores or play again with a new deck or at a higher difficulty or Stake.Balatro achieves the singleplayer experience of Solitaire that inspired it but it also feels like a hybrid of a card game and an autobattler at times. Both Balatro and Teamfight Tactics, for example, require the player to manage their economy, take direction from what appears in the shop, use currency to reroll the shop, and know how and when to pivot their build. Just imagine that you replace all the units with cards and the PvP rounds in TFT with a Hearthstone lethal puzzle and you basically have Balatro.Balatro invokes in me the experience that the critic from Pixars Ratatouille has when he sits down at Gusteaus and takes that first bite. He is served a common peasants dish, one that reminds him of his earliest years, and yet it is executed on so masterfully that the dish, to him, feels fresh and new. This game serves me something that is familiar on the surface a standard deck of 52 cards accompanied by a series of snaps and clicks that throw me back to sitting atop my fathers knee. Beneath the top layer lies a court of jesters and fools that breathe life into the humble playing card and I am invited to taste and savour all of the games possible combinations. What I am left with every time I put Balatro down is a feeling of satisfaction yet a yearning for more. This game is what any hungry card game enjoyers palate ought to crave. It is, for me, a game that I will always come back to. The one you boot up when theres nothing else to play, or on a rainy Saturday afternoon in early 2025. It is endlessly replayable with so many card and Joker combinations, unlockables, challenges, and difficulties. It can be as relaxing or demanding as you like as simple or difficult as you require. Buy Balatro and call your dad or perhaps someone elses dad. Tell him about the greatest game youve ever bought for just 15. Balatro is deckbuilding genius, and crazy addictive.  It takes maybe 10 minutes for the basic parameters of the game to make sense and then you spend the next 50 hours coming up with different strategies to make your score soar into the stratosphere like the weight on a carnival strength testing machine breaking the bell off the top of the stand.  Ill also say that I think its fantastic that a game that is so closely tied to Poker has nothing in the way of micro transactions or abuse of actual gambling.  Love to see an Indie game of this pathos thriving.",
        "summary": "This game is what it must have felt like for people in the 80s when Tetris came out. After playing this for a week straight my dreams are full of card suits and just me discarding deck after deck. Only play this if youre prepared to not do anything else for a few days. This game is actually addictive."

        "text": "DISCLAIMER  Yes, Ive played this game for 200 hours. It is not unpleasant, just flawed and unbalanced. Thats what this review is about, and Id be an idiot if I hadnt played a lot before writing it, because, guess what, properly understanding a game takes time.People fixating on my playtime and looking for a fight in the comments wont find it. If youre looking for an educated review and not a snap judgment, lets get started.This was a really fun game to discover. I certainly get all the hype around it. But it also turns out to be very superficial.Contrary to most deckbuildingdeckbuilding-adjacent roguelikes, where you have to make concessions and constant adaptations to an imperfect build in order to win, Balatro rewards you for being single-minded.You only need a little flexibility in the beginning, until you figure out what hand andor couple jokers will carry you, at which point the best and only move is to tunnel vision really hard into it, and just play the same hand over and over again, until you win. A process which starts very, very early in a run.Basically, it lacks a whole layer of complexity to keep it fresh in the long run. That, and endgames are super redundant.Worse, the formula for a winning run rarely ever changes. At least a joker that gives chips, at least a joker that gives mult, ideally a joker that gives xmult, at least one of which has to be a strong-scaling one, and then whatever you can fit in how little space you have left that can complement it. It doesnt matter what kind of hand you play, as long as it fits your joker line-up and you manage to make it spammable and despite timid steps having been taken in the last update, high card still is the most reliable hand by far.So it feels to me that not only you play the same hand over and over, you actually play the same run, over and over, barring edge cases.You always need the same couple of things, and there just isnt that much variety in how you can gather them. Somehow, it makes sense. After all, you rarely get to make really game-changing tweaks to your deck, and even then, most of the work comes from the jokers, which you only get to carry 5 of, and whose effects very rarely reach beyond a will reward you X for playing X type of hand level of complexity. Kind of feels like playing Slay the Spire with only common cards and a hard cap on relics.On top difficulty, while smart thinking obviously does help, the game is primarily won by finding something worth committing to early enough, and then getting lucky enough to find stuff that complements it, or the other way around. And, if youre doing decently, but didnt get offered the boss reroll item, you might still end up losing at the very end, to one of the 5 possible final bosses, that takes 3 times as many points to defeat. 3 mostly uneventful bosses, one that can occasionally be a challenge, and then one that will automatically end most runs. And I mean, most runs. Do the math, 1.2 million really takes a lot of luck to be theoretically doable. Thats some fine design right there.The game also suffers from a lot of pointless content that doesnt add much to the experience but makes completion more grindy than it needs to be like, 5-ish starting decks - the equivalent of playable characters - making somewhat significant changes to the gameplay, and another 10 that pretty much all play the same way.Finally, some minor nitpicking  at least one mechanic feels like it was just copied from other popular games without understanding why it belonged there and not here  the interest system.While it made a ton of sense in TFT, for instance, it brings a false sense of depth to the game, and turns out to do the exact opposite of that, as it further incentivizes you to think in black and white if this isnt a perfect fit for my build and I dont need it to survive right now, heres another excuse to dismiss it. Essentially a way to take away some liberty from the player, while tricking them into thinking theyre getting more of it, and again, rewarding single-mindedness.I suppose certain folks will be happy with it, as it does very much have that power trip aspect that Ive seen lots of people complain is missing in StSLBALother similar games.As far as Im concerned, though, having to make concessions to make an imperfect build work is what keeps me entertained - and occasionally surprised - in the long run, as opposed to just dismissing everything that isnt a perfect fit. Theres a certain kind of magic in these games that I dont see in Balatro.On a sidenote, theres a lot of micro-managing to do, so if you dont like that, by all means, stay away.Edit after 40 more hours  I waited a few months before playing it again, and having little recollection of some things made it enjoyable for a while. I tried to keep an open mind, but really, I stand comforted in my views. The game promotes dichotomous thinking, and the impact of strategy vs. RNG strict sense, not a comment on difficulty is much lesser than standard in this genre.Its not bad, or stupid, or wrong. But if you like digging into games even a little, there are much better options out there.Edit after another 80 hours  Since I was getting close to all achievements, I gave it more time. Done with that now. Unfortunately, it only threw light on more issues, which I added to the review. I understand that Im going against consensus here, but honestly, I find Balatro pretty boring. While it did initially peak my interest as a lover of rogue-likes, after playing it and beating several runs, what is on display really disappointed me. Things I liked- The music is great! A nice chill vibe with delicious synth. Sound design too. - Top notch UI design. Very neatly and intelligently laid out.- The art and aesthetic is unique and nice to look at. - There is very little fluff and fat to this game. It is straight to the point and doesnt waste your time in getting to the core gameplay loop. Things I disliked- Said core gameplay loop is VERY dry. Like a combination of solitaire and a cookie-clicker-type game. If Old Maid gets your blood pumping, then you may feel differently. - The luckskill weighting is heavily weighted towards luck. What cards you draw. What jokers you find. What boss binds you encounter. With most rogue-likes Ive played, its entirely possible to beat a run while taking no buffs using only your own knowledge and skill. Itd be a lot harder, but within the realm of possibility. With Balatro, whether you win or not feels less like youve put together a master plan to pull off a victory and more like the Joker Gods have decided that youre allowed to win this time, as a treat. Its impossible to beat a run using a standard deck and no jokersplanetstarot.I wont say that this game lacks depth. Pokersolitare has been very cleverly taken to its most extreme conclusion. Its just when the entirety of these cards games are explored, the results arent very interesting. Balatro is a game whos main enjoyment stems from seeing a number get bigger and the little dopamine kick you get when finding a foiled card in a pack of Pokemon cards. If you want a skill-based rogue-like, go play Binding of Isaac. If you want a deckbuilder, go play Slay the SpireIf you want poker, a deck of cards is about 120th the price of this gameGuess Im not the target audience. A surprisingly addictive game, ruined by the fact that most runs are impossible to win at high stakes, especially if you do not rely on the boring meta. Dont get me wrong, I love hard games. As a matter of fact, the first thing I look for on rogue-lite negative comments are people saying that the game is too hard. That is a bonus for me. I am a glutton for punishment. However, this is not that. When I say it is impossible to win most runs, I mean it is impossible to win most runs. To show you what I mean, here is a breakdown of how to start your runs at high stakes1 Win the first ante with 1 hand to ensure you have enough cash to buy a good joker in the shop. Can you win in 1 hand? No? Time to re-roll your run.2 Check the shop. Is there a half decent joker there? Great! No? Time to re-roll your run. If you do not follow these steps, you absolutely, without a doubt, will lose your run by the 4th blind due to the crazy high difficulty scaling and have to restart anyways. The biggest problem here is the fact that the shop consistently offers you tarot and planet card, which are not really worth your money until later in the run due to the interest system. When the shop isnt offering you tarot and planet cards, it is offering you a joker that is too niche to be useful at the start of the game. This leads to constant restarts, whether you have the foresight to just re-roll in the first round, or try to defy the inevitable by progressing without decent jokers. I realized that I was spending about 34 of my time playing this game just wasting time by restarting my runs. I will mention that the rest of the time that you spend progressing is actually very fun! However, even that fun is bogged down by an incredibly boring and repetitive meta. As it stands, the only consistent way to win the game is with high card. That does not mean you cannot win with other hand types, but high card is certainly the most powerful. This is because of 2 key pieces 1 Consistency The inherent problem in a game like this is that, while you can tailor your build to any complex hand you like, your run can get borked at any moment due to bad rng when you dont draw it. Are you doing a flush build? 3 of a kind? Full house? Cool. What if you dont draw that hand? You lose your run, thats what. There are things you can do to mitigate this, but it will never be guaranteed that your hand will be drawn when you need it. 2 Scaling There are a lot of jokers that have neat scaling ideas like , , and  to name a few. The problem with these kinds of jokers and their scaling around hands played and discards ties right back up to the consistency piece. What is the one hand you know you can play any time? What is the one hand you will never have to discard to find? High card. Because of this, it has synergy with more jokers than any other hand by a wide margin. All of that to say, there is something really special here. This game can be crazy addictive. What the game needs is to follow through on its addictive gameplay, by allowing me to actually take part in the addictive gameplay instead of a reroll simulator with the same boring loop of a meta. I really liked Balatro... at first.The game is exactly what it says on the tin. Its a poker rogue-lite based around collecting jokers with various interacting effects and enhancing your deck through adding, removing, altering and upgrading cards. The game really hooks you with this from the get go. Building your suite of jokers is fun, and managing your money and deck to create the highest combos you can can be satisfying, especially with some of the weirder Joker combos. The UI, sounds, and art direction ramps it up from fun to surprisingly addictive. Animations are snappy, sounds are crisp and fun, and the UI is informative yet minimal in a positive way. This combo of snappy presentation and quick resource management and synergy building really hooked me when I started playing, but as my playtime grew and I climbed up the difficulty levels, the ugly side of Balatro began to show itself. Because the game is based around poker, youre heavily at the mercy of RNG from the very start. The earliest blinds when you have nothing are just... playing poker, fishing around for high scoring hands, just discarding and praying. With a 52 cards or 40 with abandoned deck, there isnt any real control you can exert from the get go, and the control you do get is limited to what jokers and enhancements you have. Because jokers, vouchers, card upgrades, consumables, etc. are all located in the shop, the shop is the only meaningful avenue to take consistent action in Balatro. But theres more RNG there too. You dont control what shows up in the shop. It could be crap jokers or early double tarot cards when you want any jokers at all, or it could be game-changing or game-winning OP jokers. With only 2 slots for purchasable jokers and consumables in the shop at the start, you only get a few opportunities to get your deck up and running, and to get money to take advantage of those opportunities, you need to beat blinds or skip blinds in a way that gets you that money... which means, early on, lucking into good draws and good blind skip opportunities. This early game misery only gets worse as the difficulty increases, limiting your opportunities to make money and making it harder to survive if you get bad jokers early on.Even with the early game woes aside, the game is just so RNG heavy that meaningful skill expression barely exists. All that matters is getting good jokers and guaranteeing powerful hands through deck alteration.Youre at the mercy of what shows up in the shop, which you can only take advantage of with money, which you get good amounts of from winning blinds in a the fewest hands, which you can only get from the mercy of your deck drawing good for you. Or you can skip blinds when the skip gives you money, but thats also luck. The difficulty system in this game only makes this worse in an unfun way, gradually cutting away resources. One out of three blinds gives no innate money, faster scaling point requirements, less discards, less hand size, etc...But lets say you love Balatro and you power through. How do you consistently beat these increasingly harsh odds? What do you value and what do you do? Well, since all you can really meaningfully do is shop at the store, you look for three things chip generators, mult multiplier for the chip value generators, and mult multipliers. You look for these three things every single run, and as the stakes rise, you increasingly look for early scaling versions of all of these. What this means is that most runs turn into some variation of the same things beat or skip the early blinds with good value by drawing well or lucking into good blind skip rewards, manage your money until you can luck into some scaling in the shop andor luck into some mult multers in the shop, and just make sure you dont run into a boss blind effect that can kill your run. How do you do that? Well theres a boss reroll voucher. How does it show up? In the shop... at random...My final few hours of Balatro consisted of two things. One getting really fun and powerful wacky combos that got obliterated by a boss blind debuff because it either killed my strategy or I uncontrollably drew poorly, and I never saw the boss reroll voucher. Two winning because I lucked into godly jokers that fulfilled the above criteria or my wacky combo never got hard countered. I watched some YouTube videos of people playing the highest difficulty of this game and noticed that they tended to pick the same jokers pretty often, and that often the only skill they expressed was judging odds to draw a hand from your remaining deck, managing money, and recognizing good jokers. Thats it. Thats all you really get to do in this game. And I dont even think I consider two of those real skill as much as just things to consider.For me to really recommend Balatro as something more than a Vampire Survivors-esque dopamine factory, it needs to change in a major way. There needs to be more for you to meaningfully do in a run besides fish for good jokers and count your dollars, and the higher difficulties need to meaningfully spice up the formula instead of primarily just making your runs worse. As of right now, I cant recommend it unless youre content with a flashy, well-produced, and addictive but ultimately shallow experience. I was surprised at how repetitive the game felt after a few plays.  Even with different decks and jokers it just feels like youre trying to find that broken combo or fail at getting lucky.  Not my kind of game I guess.  Ill keep waiting for Slay the Spire 2. If you actually read the well written negative reviews youll find a consistent themeWhich is essentially great initial impression, but really becomes too RNG dependent at higher stakes.Go and post that on the forums and youll get the same 4 people saying the same things that dont actually negate that complaint, they just want you to feel like its some sort of skill issue.Yes, me discarding 15 cards in a row to get just one heart card to complete my flush and still not getting it is definitely a skill issue.  Why didnt I think of that.Mind you thats not the main complaint I have with the game, but the above scenario does happen, I only bring it up because I know when Im RNGd vs me making a very poor decision.  Im experienced enough of a gamer to understand the difference.Look, this game being a poker-based card game inherantly comes with some RNG in mind, Im totally alright with that concept.  Go dig around in my profile and take a look at my played time with both of the Binding of Isaacs if you must.  And Im not even complaining that I dont win every attempt, it should be fairly obvious if you analyze my achievements and the games I gravitate towards that Im alright with difficult games, in fact I prefer them, however, for Balatro specifically its that the vast majority of my runs succumbing to RNG in the same way which is the issue.The game at higher stakes is totally beatable, it just takes the correct grouping of jokers to do so, and most the time I lose, its not because I made a bad build through awful choices and thought it was actually really good, its simply because not enough decent ones came through the store and I couldnt make much of anything at all.Its a really unfun and stale way to lose, and especially more so when its so often.  When I win, its not because I learned more of the games ins and outs, its because finally the game gave me anywhere from a decent set to a god-tier set jokers.If the game is going to bank on situational jokers stacking effects with other situational jokers to maximize points, then I need to be able to sift through more available jokers to create a workable build.  The fact is I get so few as I progress, I cant tell you how many times Ive had what could be a super potent build but is missing like one other component to it, then have enough cash to throw about 5-15 rerolls in the shop to just get nothing but unusable garbage.  There are too many jokers available to choose from compared to how many you see per run to reliably be creative with builds, is the way I see it.  Most the time youre just stuck with un-synergized crap.And dont even get me started on some of the boss encounters that will easily negate your build in one fell swoop, theres ways to change the boss blind mechanic, however its never available when you genuinely need it.Ultimately the game is addicting and really blew my mind when I first got into it, I dumped 50 hours into it in like a week.  But the more I analyze it and dig deeper into its systems, the more the game just looks like a massive waste of my time, a good game does the opposite where as you learn it you are rewarded with more progress.Its genuinely unfortunate. Im giving this game a thumbs-down, but I understand that for a lot of people, the things I describe about it are upsides. In that case, play away no skin off my back.This is a fine game. But Ive heard it described as a slot machine disguised as a strategy game. Which... well youre playing poker, so slot machine elements shouldnt be abnormal. And indeed, it makes sense that theres a massive degree of randomness. However, it really feels like theres only one dominant strategy and the mind game is just figuring out what that should be. For example, in this game you typically have a build in each run designed around scoring a particular poker hand. And you realistically have three options multiples e.g., 3, 4 of a kind and full house, flushes, and straights. Now, the problem is that with the tools you have available to you, straights are much harder to consistently achieve than flushes. You have consumables that change the suits of cards--good for flushes. Comsumables that increase the rank of cards--bad for straights. Consumables that turn all cards in hand to one suit--good for flushes. Consumables that remove cards from your deck--good for flushes remove all of an unwanted suit, unclear for straights. A really common artifact that makes the black suits and the red suits work as each other for flushes, reducing the number of suits from 4 to 2. Hell, flushes are even worth slightly more than straights.This means that every run, I dont really feel like Im being challenged strategically. Its a game of identifying the worthless garbage jokers from the moderate to ok jokers. At the end of every run I find myself wondering, is this actually a good game? I dont think so. I think it might be a bad game. But the worst part is that even though I think it might be a bad game, I want to play more. I want to spin more. I want to roll the dice one more time. And I hate that feeling. I hate the way this game makes me feel. I dont hate this game, but I hate this feeling. i guess better to get acquanted with this feeling in this low-cost contest than the get addicted to casinos or gacha games. Thats a small relief Its not a bad game, by any stretch, but once you play long enough you realize that for all the options you are presented with, only a handful are viable, and it relies entirely on luck. Playing through the first 3 antes is almost always the same, and by the time your deck starts to get any personality youve almost certainly lost. If youre winning its not because you played well, its because you got the right Jokers, were offered the right blinds, or got a particularly lucky option in a pack. Eventually you just find yourself rerolling the opening ante over and over again, hoping for the one set of options that will give you a fighting chance. Youre not even playing the game at that point, youre just gaming the system in the most boring, meta way possible. Its a good game until you realize you stopped enjoying it a while ago, and the promises ring hollow. Despite the time Ive put into this game, I cant recommend it. Whenever I set this game down, I am generally bummed about a run and wishing I had played something else.The game at higher difficulties is not interactive, it does not encourage you to do anything other than to hold R to restart until you see an optimal start, then hope the start actually pans out. After that, you have to hope you get the jokers and cards you need, in the time and limited resources you have, in order to overcome a boss that may have a perk that could seem tailor designed to shut your deck down. At the higher difficulties, this is all dependent on your luck, not skill. This is not controversial, this is the general sentiment in discussions threads about the game.The entire time Im experiencing this, I think back to my time watching Eden streaks in Binding of Isaac, where it seems that every run is beatable. Even on the highest difficulties, even with the worst rng, you theoretically could weave the shots and kill a boss. You could make the most of the tools you have. In balatro, your deck may finally be coming together, youre building momentum to finally beat orange stake, but then an ante boss hits you with a perk like very large blind or only 1 hand, and you lose. Or maybe you could actually beat it, but somehow you cant draw anything in a deck that has otherwise been consistent, and you lose.In Isaac, even if I lost a run I probably found some cool new synergy, some new aspect of the game, or at least was left wondering what potential my next run was hiding. In Balatro, Im left wondering if my next orange stake run has the potential to get past ante 2. I concede maybe I am asking this game to be something its not. Its clearly popular and addictive, but despite the time Ive invested, and the likelihood I got my moneys worth, I dont think I can recommend it. Id be hard pressed to say the game isnt good, but Id be equally hard pressed to say it is fun when you really start to sink your teeth in. Instead, Im confident its just addictive. At the least? Its better than a casino, if thats what you need. The game starts great and then drowns. RNG is unbelievable. You dont have control over anything at higher stakes. Once you have opened enough jokers, its unreal to build a good deck. You dont decide anything - game decides for you.Most decks doesnt change the gameplay at all. Some of them are not balanced at all. Significant part of the jokers does the same things but with higher numbers. A lot jokers are completely useless and dumb.This is not how the card roguelike should work. You have to have control. Everyone loves this game for some reason, but I cant understand why. I tried searching Blatro bad game and I didnt like Balatro and the results are I love Balatro so bad or I didnt think I would like Balatro this much.What I think a video game should bewhat I like is to solve challenges, either by making decisions or mechanics. Balatro has neither of them, and is boring in a frustrating way.This game is a strategy game that looks like a casino. What they forgot to tell you is that its actually a casino pretending to be a strategy game that looks like a casino- When you first launch the game you will think Oh this is really cool I have to make a decision whether I wanthave to greed for better hands, or go for something thats easier to make. No, you dont. Once you buy your first jokersplanet card those upgrade specific hands you will effectively be locked into that particular hand for the rest of the run. If you want to go for any consistency, the entire way through you will play pairs, two pairs, and high cards, maybe a flush if you feel fancy. There are no other hands you can realistically expect to repeat in a standard deck. Making pairs out of playing cards is not very fun and you can buy a deck of cards much cheaper if you want to do that instead. It is less bad on low difficulties, but if you care about optimal play you are doomed anyway.- So if the battle has zero decisionsthinking involved, maybe at least the shop does? Not really, If you decided that your life belongs to the High Card Jail, you buy whatever jokers support that playstyle, and its not hard to figure out. There are jokers that give you consistent results and you buy them. Planet cards require no thought. Exception are tarot cards, especially the ones you can play during a fight. Those allow for deck interaction, and theres a limited number of situations where you have to think before you clik a button, however- Difficulty scales in the worst possible way for a game to scale game gives you less hands, less discards and less gold in shops. All of these things remove already small amount of decisions that you have in this game. Less discards? I guess you play High Cards and Pairs, hope you have fun. Less gold? You probably cant afford to buy those fun tarot cards, because all your money is to be spent on the jokers that give you more power. It turns the game into a restart fiesta, where you go into the first shop or two, and then press restart because you didnt get any of the things that make you win the game, and if you win the joker gamble you reward is playing high card for the next 20 minutes or so, yaay.I like the presentation of this game, it has a great vibe, but it is nothing but flashing lights. Turns out that making poker hands not even really is not that great of a gameplay loop as you would think past initial 15 minutes. It starts off very strong, but the more I play and climb the higher difficulties the less I feel like theres any strategy in the game because all Im doing is stacking bonuses on a particular hand type or win condition. Lets take Flushes for example, which are incredibly easy to manipulate and easy to climb with. You HAVE to stack all your bonuses on that one hand type because spreading out wont get you enough chips to beat the boss blinds. So all youre really doing is playing match the colours and not poker at all. The more I play, the more I begin to hate this game so I just stopped playing altogether. Its fun in concept but fizzles out fast due to being very poorly balanced, too grindy to unlock everything, and way too RNG heavy. Balatro is the kind of game where you either hit it high and land on the moon, or die in the first ante on higher stakes. The deck balance is also all over the place, some are basically unplayable e.g. black deck, others are way too powerful e.g. plasma deck.It was fun when it was novel, but at some point you find yourself just spending half an hour rerolling for the perfect start because some of the challenges and decks are literally unbeatable without getting insanely lucky in the early game. It is a far cry from the likes of the well-balanced roguelikes it draws inspiration from.Apart from fixing the massive issues with card, boss and deck balance, an easy improvement to the status quo would be to e.g. guarantee a powerful joker after beating a boss, the way most other roguelikes do this. Rather than just leaving it up to chance.There are another couple of design choices I dislike, e.g. stakes being tied to the deck choice - which makes it so you basically lock yourself in to a certain deck and have to grind out the lower difficulties again if you want to ever play a different one. This really hurts the replayability of the game. Adding to this overall monotony is the fact that most strong decks rely on the same few jokers and tarot cards, and the strongest strategies consistently spend a lot of time just idly abusing some value-generating joker, only to lose all this progress to some unlucky boss.Balatro is the kind of game where its more fun to watch somebody elses high roll video on youtube than to play for hours trying to get that high roll yourself. Or just save your time by unlocking all of the collection at the start with a cheat code, so you can actually play what you want to play instead of being forced to suffer through a monotonous grind to unlock it in the first place. Game is very fun at lower difficulty, lots of room for strategy and creativity as you explore the game. However at higher difficulty and for most challenges, the strategy devolves to rerolling till you get the right jokers.  The more you learn the game the more boring it gets. After fully unlocking everything, hundreds of hours of work, the save file reset spontaneously.  Based on some research, this is a bug with the game that has affected hundreds of people.  There is no fix and no acknowledgement of it.  Avoid the game until its fixed. Its enjoyable at the beginning when you are still optimistic about what combos you can make, but once you play for awhile youll rapidly see its not nearly as interesting as you thought and depending on the deck and difficulty you have to play in very specific ways. I am not one who really enjoys card games but bought based on all the hype.Its not addicting, more its something you can play when youre multitasking and dont really want to focus on it too much. But after awhile I realized this is just tedious and not fun. I dont see myself ever returning to this and cant even say of most of the hours I had lots of fun it was just kind of something to do. Save your money and buy a better game, this one is not it and really unworthy of your time. Its a well made game and people obviously love it, which is great, but this game is not my cup of tea.  All you do is play hands to earn money to buy bonuses to play more hands. It feels like a pokie slot machine and Ive never been eager to play those. I really, really wanted to like this but it feels miserable to play when the shop doesnt give me anything meaningful for 10 runs and then throws in a boss blind that hard counters my setup when I finally get jokers that even work together. I can see why this games as popular as it is, but I cant even squeeze the tiniest bit of fun out of it.I probably should have expected this game to be entirely RNG dependent though. That ones on me. At least the musics good I guess. Balatro is a neat concept, but the game mechanics are just frustrating. Paired with no real sense of progression, theres no way to fix a run. You can build your deck, enjoy your run, and just into a boss that says no and theres nothing you can do about it. There isnt time to rebuild, no way to recover. Its just frustrating and cant really recommend the game in good conscious. I would like to preface this by saying that it is a not so bad game, but I find something very concerningIt is impossible to reach end game without a specific build, with very few variations. The only thing that work is multiplicative multiplicators. Everything else chips, additive multiplicator, figures upgrade, card upgrades... barely even matters. What matters is doubling everything 8 times or more. It becomes very dull once you figure this out, since the cards that make this possible are extremely rare, and need to be unlocked through RNG draw of a RNG lottery card.The main issue here is that there is no fixing this. The game was built in a way that REQUIRES you to get those x2 multiplicators to win. I dont see a world where this can be fixed.Anyhow, it is fun for a while, and having a good run is satisfying, but if its too good, youll just steamroll everything with a single pair, until the exponential growth of the objectives catches up with you. Even that gets stale imo.Can it be improved ? Maybe, but not sure it will.",
        "summary": "Balatro rewards you for being single-minded. The formula for a winning run rarely ever changes. The game is primarily won by finding something worth committing to early enough, and then getting lucky enough to find stuff that complements it. It feels like playing Slay the Spire with only common cards and a hard cap on relics."

        "text": "An example to all those stuck in Early Access. These developers set realistic goals. Listened to feedback. Gave weekly updates. and released the game in less than a year with MAJOR improvements. They always responded to comments and made the users feel listened too. The game is just excellent in its pollished form. Each character feels unique and each run feels unique. Endless hours of entertainment. But mostly, Im impressed by the developers work ethics here. In my opinion, this is the best roguelite deckbuilder ever made and also in contention for the best roguelite ever. The design of the game is close to perfect -- every card, relic, and enemy is in for a reason and serves a purpose, and theres almost no additions to the game that serve to just up the item count without offering interesting playstyle consequences. Its very easy to understand, and yet that betrays its considerable depth and endless replayability. Its very good! With the accessibility mods available for this game, it is completely playable for blind gamers, like myself, who use screen readers. The game play is rich while being easy to learn which leads to hours of entertainment. This is a game I keep returning to play. This is the best game on Steam, especially if youre an adult. You can stop playing at literally any moment, you dont even need to pause you dont need internet connection, so you can play on a plane its incredibly deep, brilliant, fun, and as immersive as you can afford to be immersed without punishing you for not being able to commit. Its fun to learn, and once you have knowledge of the game, its not about maintaining a skill like FPSs or constantly keeping up with the Devs changes like MOBAs. Its like riding a bike, so an adult can come back at any moment without feeling the frustration of being out of practice or getting steamrolled by the most recently buffed thing. I hope that this kind of game is the future of gaming for adults.Thank you for creating this. I love card games of all types. I grew up playing traditional card games like Crazy Eights, Solitaire and Uno. I later got into Bridge, Rummy and Poker until Magic the Gathering MtG consumed my life for years.These days though its hard to find people to play traditional card games anymore and Magic the Gathering and other CCGs are way too expensive to keep up to date with.A few years ago I discovered physical deck building games like Dominion, Thunderstone, Race for the Galaxy and many more. I had a ton of fun playing these, but again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so I turned to the PC. Several of these games have pretty good PC versions, but they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games. There are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down. Thats fine when playing with friends at home, but over the Internet or alone against an AI it tends to get old pretty fast.There have been quite a few digital card games recent years that are great, but most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even Magic the Gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cards.Then come Slay the Spire, A game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before I finally gave it a chance. This little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things I love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it I struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much I want to say.Drawing your cardsThe reason I love card games today as much as I did as a kid is for the simple feeling you get when you are dealt your cards, you pick them up and see if you have a good hand. That rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets old, its why I got so heavily into Magic the Gathering, since apposed to games like Bridge or Rummy you get to draw new cards constantly. This is also true for deck builders and even more so with Slay the Spire than many others since you play your hand fast and dont have to worry about building your deck while youre playing it. This brings me to my second point...Building the deckSlay the Spire has done a genius move by taking the deck building aspects of a deck builder away from the action of playing. So when I am in a fight I dont have to think for 2 minutes about which card to get like you have to do in Dominion style games. After a fight is over you are rewarded with a selection of new cards and only then do you have to make decisions about what card to pick. And that choice is always informed by how the last battle went, so you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card. I really love building my deck as I play with it, its how I used to tinker with my MtG decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me. Slay the Spire has the incremental building of a deck builder, but without the constant stop and think style of play which slow those games down. This makes the pacing of the game much more interesting. You have an action phase, followed by a thinking phase. Rather than jumbling them both into each other.Playing the cardsAll this would be for naught had the game not been fun to play. Thankfully the cards are interesting and have a ton of cool interactions with each other. There are many different types of decks you can build and they can often change and adapt as you play if you find that one rare card or relic you can build a whole deck around. This makes the game extremely re-playable, more so than any other deck builder Ive played. While games like Dominion and Thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play I simply find myself enjoying what I can do in Slay the Spire more. It also plays very fast, it flows a bit like Heartstone in that sense, unless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orders.Best of both worldsSince Slay the Spire is a digital card game rather than a physical one it is not restricted to the laws that govern how a regular card game plays. This means they can do a lot of stuff that simply isnt possible or takes too long for physical games. Each fight is against one or several monsters who before your turn indicate what they are going to do over their heads, which usually is either attack, block or apply some buffdebuff. This means what you do on your turn is informed by that. If the monster attacks, you block, if it blocks or buffs itself you attack. Having this kind of AI interaction in a physical game could be possible, but would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds. As you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of them, making each game a little easier than the previous. Its not just your deck thats getting better, its your ability to play it as well.The game also has a lot of statuses such as buffs and debuffs - kind of like how MtG works, which is one of the reasons why MtG can take forever to play, but with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background. The digital version of Magic the Gathering handles these things for you as well, but since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than Slay the Spire.Just one more turn...I am also a huge turn based strategy fan, Civilization being my favorite game of the genre. That genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and on, one more turn at a time, even though I know I should have stopped hours ago. Slay the Spire does the same thing for me. Each game of Slay the Spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floor, if you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run. It plays similarly to a Rogue Like in that way, a genre that Ive always been fascinated by, but never got very deep into, but Slay the Spire got its hooks into me very hard. It took me quite the force of will to say No to another game so I could take the time to write this review. I cant wait until its over so I can try out the latest patch. Which reminds me...Early AccessThe elephant in the room in my opinion is the fact that the game is in Early Access. That to me is always a HUGE red flag. There are a few games though such as Factorio, Rim World, Subnautica, Prison Architect, Oxygen Not Included and others that actually listen to their community, provide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is. Slay the Spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question. The technical aspects of the game is top notch, it plays smoothly, theres a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks Ive played it. With a clearly defined Roadmap that promise more content in a game I feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over. I have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today I would be more than satisfied with my purchase.Finishing thoughtsThis is a game I am going to be playing for years to come and while it already has enough content to justify that today I can imagine limitless possibilities for it in the future. More game modes such as infinite, restricted cards, special relics or modifiers, new cards, more monsters, new characters, etc. I feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you dont really see all that often. It has taken the best from many different genres, combined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its parts.I think Slay the Spire is a game we will be talking about for years to come as a genre defining game. It has my full recommendation! The problem with slay the spire is that it made all the other roguelite deckbuilders obsolete before they even came out. Nothing feels as good as getting a good deck synergy going. Makes you feel like an absolute genius for knowing how to read. pretty good game except for the jaw wurm. i cannot for the life of me understand how the devs put out patch after patch without nerfing this ridiculous enemy. you might as well put the final boss of the game on the first floor. runs are won and lost based entirely on enemy rng. butr otehr thanf that, quite good, love the graphics. My account says 19 hours played-- I have over 500 hours on this game on iOS.STS is a video game. It has monsters that you have to kill, cool moves you can do, levels that you need to go through, you know, video gamey stuff. It even has potions. Still, I decided to look at it as something a bit more than just a video game.I started off playing STS with zero deckbuilder experience. I struggled up till I finally managed to win a run. I eventually made it to the real final boss of the game, and I was like, yeah this is stupid difficult, do people actually win against this?Fast forward a year later, and yeah people win against it. Not only that, but they win against it with handicaps. It starts off with one handicap. Then you get another. And another. Its like you already have the odds against you, but you stack them against you even more. And more, up to 20 different disadvantages to start off with. Yet people still win consistently at the game. How is that?As I learned more about the cards. How they synergize. How to anticipate my opponents and make arrangements for the possibility of my meeting them, I started to understand. In this game, youre given a deck of cards. You cant control what cards you will find, nor what elites or bosses you will encounter. Never the less, through your own decision making, you can turn squalid conditions to your advantage and come out on top despite the odds.In this way, I decided to view this as more than just a game. Its a simulation that demonstrates the power of making decisions that have thought behind them. Decisions that weigh pros and cons, that consider consequences. I learned that a bad situation, even if it is bad and will certainly end bad, does not have to be as bad as it gets. By carefully considering options, studying the situation, one can mitigate whatever negative aspects exist in any given situation. If they are also lucky, or particularly gifted, they may even reverse it into a good situation.To me STS served as a reminder of that, and as a good demonstration of how powerful this concept is. I was able to go from a situation I really was convinced was hopeless, to being able to regularly and casually beat that same boss that I thought was impossible a year back, with at least 10-12 different handicaps on top of that. All because I changed how I think and how I made decisions.I recommend this game to anyone. Even if you dont choose to learn life lessons from it, you still have an exceptional game to play. I have over 6k hours in this game. Im still playing it, i still boot it up all the time. Its incredibly, incredibly good. Absoloute gold standard. I could squee for years about its design, but seriously.SIX. THOUSAND. HOURS. PLAYING. THIS. GAME.Its that much value for money. Im a dad. I have various dadly duties that pull me away from gaming a lot. Slay the Spire is short, digestible, and I can leave it whenever I need and come back when I can without worry of missing out on something. Plus. StS2 is coming out soon. Lots of bang for your buck here so if you enjoy deck builders and roguelikes plus have a multitude of dadly or momly duties, this is where its at. Very fun, casual game. Lots of value as it increases difficulty as you progress for new challenges. I play too much. I dont have a lot of time for gaming anymore and with around 1000 games in my library Ive never even played, Im trying to cut back on buying new ones. So when a friend told me I had to play this one, I was skeptical. I do love card games and strategy - but I also have a lot of burnout from poor Early Access experiences and since my maternity leave is over and now I have to ugh, make money AND look after a baby, absolutely no spare time for gaming. So I surprised myself when I realized that three days after launching this, Id managed to clock up 15 hours. That pile of paperwork next to me, the unfinished laundry and my mums messages asking if Im okay because she hasnt heard from me for a few days may be related in some way, but you cant prove anything! I was so tired last night I beat the final boss with the Ironclad for the first time, sent a screenshot to the friend who bullied me into playing the game essential step, turned my PC off, walked to bed and fell asleep, to dream of deck building.Despite my friend having played double my hours and generally being vastly superior at games to me, his playstyle choices have been vastly different. He prefers Silent, the poison character, whereas I prefer Ironclad, the strength deck. Hed never used the style of deck I used to get my first win barricade, massive armor stacking, dual wield into body slam and I played with quite a few different deck types before settling on my winning synergy. Even though there are not a massive array of cards, there is a significant amount of choice and strategy in your play, coupled with constant adjustments needing to be made as you pick up relics and rewards.With over 9,000 reviews no I mean literally, thats not a meme and overwhelmingly positive, you dont need someone slow to this bandwagon to describe the mechanics of the game. What I will say is this is a fun roguelike deck-building card game that is simple to grasp, hard to master and incredibly addictive. Id love to say it can be played in short bursts when you have 30 minutes here and there, but only if youve levelled your willpower to max and can walk away from the PC.Highly recommended from me, even in Early Access, with hopefully even more content to come. If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  My Curator Page This review is for casual to mid-range gamers, because there are plenty of reviews from the competitive crowd that go into much more intense detail than I am capable of doing.Ill keep this short, because in the end all Im doing is throwing my hat in the ring with 97 of other Slay the Spire players in saying this game is 100 worth your money.  So Ill address the one thing I havent seen any other reviews talking about.The difficultycomplexity curve in Slay the Spire is about as close to perfect as it gets. Each of the four characters plays fundamentally differently, and each has multiple viable paths for building a deck. As you start learning the game, the first thing youll be doing is unlocking additional cards and relics for each character, allowing those cards and relics to show up in future runs. These unlocks slowly ramp up the complexity of the game by providing the player with more options and hinting at new deck archetypes to shoot for in future runs.By the time youve gotten all five unlocks on a character, youve likely won a run or two. Winning your first run unlocks the first of twenty Ascension levels for that character, each of which progressively makes runs on that character a bit more difficult in different ways, which are clearly noted in the character select UI.I havent progressed too far into Ascension, as Im still working on a final couple of unlocks, but even as a gamer who prefers to play games for story over mechanics, I am thoroughly impressed by how smoothly Slay the Spire eased me into the game. This is not to say the game is not difficult--it is unforgiving, moderately luck-based, and occasionally infuriating--but the developers have done a splendid job of crafting a new player onboarding ramp that makes it honestly difficult not to learn the basics of how the game works. Ive never seen such a smooth onboarding for such a difficult game, and it makes the experience far more welcoming than it has any right to be, given how gleefully the RNG will royally screw you over at times.So for casual to mid-range gamers wondering if Slay the Spire is too hardcore for them--well, it probably is, but itll do a damn fine job of getting you to a point where, for at least a little while...for a few runs every now and again...you can be hardcore too. I highly recommend it. The king of roguelike deckbuilders. The closest game to perfection games of this genre has ever gotten.I feel only slay the spire 2 will threaten this games position at the top.No Roguelike deckbuilder has ever given this level of content, of replayability of depth. Its truly a masterpiece.I cannot recommend it enough. Its cool, and fun, and even though you could be a card game specialist and one of the best players in the world, you could still find new things in this game after 1000 hours Its a good game with high replayability. I play it to escape the big sad For all the games inspired by Slay The Spire, none can match the balance, variety, replayability and depth of the original. One of those approachable games where, during your first turn youre wondering Hmm should I swing for 6 or block for 5, thats a tough one, and then 1,000 hours later you start a new run and youre still wondering Hmm, swing for 6 or block for 5...The game is so simple and addictive, its hard to understand why its special without playing it. Just try it for yourself! Let me tell you, Slay the Spire is one of those games that feels like a chaotic, card-flinging whirlwind at first. Youll dive in, gleefully throwing random attacks, eating curses for breakfast, and wondering why the elite just turned you into a squishy pancake in two turns. But heres the thing the more you play, the more you realize  this game is way less about luck and way more about skill.At its heart, Slay the Spire is a masterclass in combos and synergies. Sure, you might pick up a seemingly random hand of cards at first, but once you start connecting the dots, its like solving a puzzle where each piece gives you a new power boost. Get the right relics, nail the perfect card synergy, and suddenly, youre a juggernaut of destruction, making bosses look like confused kittens.And lets not forget the randomness  its what keeps things interesting! Each run is different, and while luck can sometimes throw you a curveball, true Spire-slayers know how to adapt, turning even the most cursed hands into epic victories. The randomness isnt frustrating  its exciting! Every run is like shaking a magic 8-ball that could either tell you youre about to destroy everything... or that youre about to get destroyed.The beauty of this game is how it tricks you. It starts out feeling chaotic, but the more you play, the more you realize its a perfectly balanced dance of risk and reward. And the deeper you go, the more the luck turns into skill, knowledge, andlets be realjust pure card-flipping satisfaction.So, if youre ready to flex your brain while occasionally cursing the RNG gods, and absolutely dominating the spire with your killer combos, this is the game for you. Happy slaying! oh i havent left a review for this yet.enough has been said about StS, yes its that good. Its honestly very rare for a game to inspire an entire genre and remain the best game in that genre for half a decade and counting. The magical thing about StS is its a rare kind of video game you can revisit after a few years and, nothing in it has changed, but somehow, it feels completely different. You see the game with new eyes and suddenly all of your previous assumptions are a jumbled mess again. Your old reliable strategies suddenly stopped working, what changed? Cards you never looked twice at are suddenly crushing a run for you. A character you never fully understood clicks. A character you thought youd mastered is completely eluding you.Slay the Spire is a really good roguelike deckbuilder. But the thing it has that many of its would-be successors do not is mystique. Can this or that thing be made to work? Is it good? How do you know when you can take it? Was that a fluke, or did you just invent a playstyle you hadnt considered until its pieces materialized for you? You won a run, impressive. Can you do it again, but cleaner this time, without coming so close to dying at this or that point--that deck was fun, could you have built it better, what was its core, what did you think was necessary but wasnt?Everything answer you arrive to in Slay the Spire is met with more questions. The game doesnt ask you them, it just presents problems and pieces of solutions. It teaches you to be curious, open-minded, and creative, beckons you to try and then try again. It isnt just special for the obvious reasons that it is well-designed, balanced, a fun interplay of little challenges and exciting rewards. It is special because it infects you with a mental itch that nothing else really seems to scratch. You begin by trying to overcome a run, and end up trying to overcome an ocean.How incredibly appropriate that at the beginning of the game, we are greeted by a monstrous whale.",

        "text": "I dont know what Im missing, but I just dont enjoy this game. I have played multiple runs, but cant get into it. Everyone else seems to point to this as the golden standard of Roguelike Deckbuilders, but this is by far my least favorite one.  Ive greatly enjoyed every other Deckbuilder Ive played Neoverse, Trails of Fire, Iris and the Giant, and Across the Obelisk.The biggest problem for me is that very little carries over from each turn. This makes it feel like there isnt much I can do to prepare for future turns, which makes the outcome feel dependent on the luck of the draw. In other Deckbuilders like Neoverse or Iris and the Giant, a lot more persists between turns which allows for more future planning. With party-based games like Across the Obelisk or Trials of Fire, you can spend one characters turn setting up another character. This makes it feel like there is always something to do, even when you get a less than ideal draw.All in all, it just falls flat. I know that Im in the minority and a lot of people will love this game, but its just not for me. After seeing so many overwhelmingly positive reviews I thought I would have more fun with the game than I actually did. Dont get me wrong, your first 10-20 runs are going to be great, but afterwards the scaling of difficulty, and inability to build the deck you actually want to use in any given run, killed off my personal interest. You might still enjoy it, but be cautious of the fact. Ive recently developed a love for card games and deck builders of late, mostly of the physical card games like Star Realms, but this has also begun to cross over into the digital realm. Having recently completed Inscyption, I was looking for a game that would give me this experience as a single player and Slay The Spire seemed to fit the bill perfectly. This is an interesting mix of roguelike and deck-building - there are randomly generated routes with branching paths that you can take. You encounter a series of random enemies on these paths, not to mention the occasional event or merchant, to keep the experience a little varied.Off the bat, the game feels fun and very intuitive - the cards themselves and the mechanics around them are well designed, with a combination of varied attacks, defenses and status effects. You get to pick up cards, potions and relics permanent effects with each such encounter, building your deck and playing a huge role in how you play your runs. Experimenting over multiple runs and figuring out the meta and how different cards synergize is a lot of fun to begin with.However, with every consecutive run, it felt like the RNG was playing a larger role than it should. Ive played a lot of games with prominent RNG systems but there is always a fine line between when RNG keeps the game fresh and when it makes you feel like you dont have control over the flow of the game. Losses often felt hopeless and wins often felt undeserved, often because of the cards or relics you get to pick up in the early game or the hand being dealt in battle.What compounds this effect is that small mistakes you make or misfortunes you encounter early in the game can punish you much later. And it feels like a wasted investment of time and effort when that happens. You could counter to an extent by experimenting a lot across many many runs or using extensively the wiki and other material available for this game on the internet. Neither options feels particularly appealing - if your design is for people to become experts before beating the game, then its not for me. Or for a large number of other gamers out there too, Im sure.The saving grace is that each run is pretty quick - in a typical run, you would often get into the second act, which would last between 15-30 min depending on how you like to take your game.There are a lot of people, where the grind, the experimentation and mechanics appeal. Sadly, Im not one of them and I cannot recommend the game. Initially, I loved this game. I liked the challenge of building a deck that could survive all the myriad of enemies...But then it got to the point where I realised that the game frustrated me more than it provided enjoyment. So many options that seem nice are traps, and they bite you hard. As soon as you start to identify how each bonus screws you over down the track you realise that unless you get a perfect roll of the dice your deck actually gets weaker on each floor you pass... and it kinda just sucks after a while.Id say 710 runs end with a case of Guess Ill die because of some random effect forced upon me, 210 runs end because I done goofed, and the last 110 runs I can actually scrape through. Might be to some peoples liking, but Id much rather lose to my own incompetence than random events. Even after 50 hours of repetitive, tedious gameplay, I still havent unlocked all the content which makes this one of the most disappointing titles thats ever been recommended to me. Both the game and the community will gaslight you constantly into believing that youre the problem for not grinding for 200 hours or applying mods so that you can play something that vaguely resembles an intellectual experience but ultimately boils down randomly rerolling until you stumble upon a decent setup. I honestly cant recommend this game as it currently is, there is way too much RNG built into it.You go on numerous runs where you probably dont really have a chance based on the cards that are available or relics that you receive. The basic premise is you keep trying until it actually offers you a synergistic build and then you could get screwed by a bad shuffle. A bad shuffle is a thing with all card games but when you factor in you went on how many previous crappy runs? It just feels really bad. There is no retry system so you just have to star over. I dont really feel like Im out played or not prepared ever, I just feel like RNG screwed me over. Whenever I talk to my friends about it the convo is never Oh thats a clever build its always How did you manage to actually get all that?. I know its a Roguelike but I still feel like there should be either more options throughout the game for building or different persistence options.There is an unlock system but honestly I was receiving some of the items prior to unlocking them so I dont quite understand how that works fully. That system is the only real progression in the game and its not much.You get 3 characters currently, I believe a 4th is underway. Talking to my friends we all kind of feel similarly The first character is kind of boringgeneric He does have build variety though, the second is pretty good with decent build variety, and the third is very RNG based because he requires some very specific cards. Overall I feel its a bit lacking considering you always start with the same deck.In terms of fights there isnt actually a whole lot of different fights, you mostly just encounter them in different orders based on your seed and the path you take. After a few full runs you will have seen all the different rooms. The monsters in a room are not randomized so there are only really 10 or so different rooms in an Act.With the steam sale I feel like I got my money out of it but I guess the basic theme of this review is I want more. I dont think you would be upset for purchasing this but I do feel like it gets stale pretty quickly. After beating it, I only really go on a one or two runs every once in a while before it gets stale. Based on RNG and your ability to deck build that could occur very shortly. One of my friends beat it in a few days.The good news is it sounds like they are still actively developing it or adding to it so it could get better in the future. One change I would like to see is starter deck variety. Maybe have the option to start The Silent with the generic starter deck, a shiv deck or a poison deck for example. It doesnt have to be THAT specific with the decks but just something different to try each time to mix it up. Starts out really fun - theres a definite skill progression. You start to unlock things and you feel yourself getting better with every game. Then... it just sort of plateaus. Skill no longer matters as much, and things start to become much more RNG reliant. The final boss is impossibly hard and basically only even reachable when RNG shines down on you to allow you a run good enough to get there.I really wanted to like this game and did everything I could to pretend that I did, but eventually I realized I wasnt playing for the right reasons anymore. Being at the mercy of brutal RNG to min-max a run is extremely frustrating. Repetitive and shallow. For a game with such a cult following and high reviews youd think there would be more variety in play styles  enemy types. You regularly see the same exact enemies, in the same exact scenarios, and depending on the character you will deal with them the same every time. After 20ish hours I struggled to find a reason to enjoy this game as it felt the exact same every single time. Dont buy into the hype. Unique concept... burrowed under ridiculous amount of RNGWhat makes a good rogue- game is requirment to improve. The world is constantly changing, but most of problems are possible to avoid or solve, if you know how. Sadly, nowadays people keep misunderstanding this concept and try to add as much of random, as possible, without providing a skill-based experience. This game isnt exception.Yeah, sure, tactics and strategy still add some points to win rates. But most of them belong to The Great RNGesus, who decide if you will win or lose. Trying to be agressive? Well, bad news, enjoy your death by lack of defence from some bullet sponge. Being a risky lurker and make your path tru unidentified rooms? Few tough enemies in a row, mixed with lack of cards will lead to unavoidable death.Play safe and invest into defence? WELL FUCK, MOBS IN MOST OF UPCOMING ROOMS WILL PUNISH YOU FOR BEING A TANK there are plenty of ways to do so - begining with frail that reduce amount of received defence from cards and ending with hex, which add garbage into your pile for each non-attack card used.Etc etc etc. Most of deaths will be unavoidable and only depend on your luck. Same for wins, tho.People dislike Darkest Dungeon for amount of randomness. But, in that case, Slay the Spire easily overlaps it. Dont get me wrong - I dont hate this game. Its intresting yet a bit short in content, for its price experience of card game additional plus point for being a CCG without microtransactions, mixed with roguelite formula. But the problem is - it relies on RNG way more, than enough.Spices are tasty, if there is just right amount of them. Sadly, this meal feature so much of them, to make its taste disgusting. Even if other ingredients used were top tier, even if chef spent so much time and effort to make it - as much as I want, I just cant recommend it. There are two ways to experience this game. Id highly recommend the first, and very strongly not recommend the second. If you pick up the game and play through a couple of runs, youll find an accessible, intriguing little card battler with a simple yet engaging core loop and a substantial variety of enemies, random events and challenges. Earning clutch victories on difficult boss battles is super satisfying, and seeing your chosen character - and personalized deck - ascend to challenge the toughest opponents in the realm is a ton of fun. You can easily complete your first run after 5 hours of gameplay, and if you stop there, youll certainly leave with a positive experience. Its when you start to take your characters through multiple runs that the game falls apart. Simply put, Slay the Spire is fundamentally unfair. So much of every run is left up to chance, from card picks, to passive boost, to enemy attack patterns. You can breeze through an hour-long run with minimal mistakes and a killer deck, only to be immediately sniped by an enemy who just happens to counter your deck or, more likely, just craps out way more damage than you can physically handle. The game expects you to overcome these challenges not through skill and strategy alone, but through luck. Sure, being careful and strategic with your play will be to your advantage, but when your character has 70hp and the game decides to randomly throw you an enemy that does 24x3 or more per turn, theres really little chance for you to respond. Your only real hope is to keep playing over and over until you get your unlocks andor just so happen to have the perfect deck and set of relics to counter whatever instagib bosses the game will throw your way.Most of what Im describing is par for the course for roguelikes, so I cant be to hard on the devs for simply falling into those tropes. But 20 hours in, I havent enjoyed the game at all since hour 3, except for one decent run which I lost due to bad planning rather than RNG shenanigans. Losing can still be fun, but it has to be fair. Slay the Spire is not. Ill be eager to see what the devs make next, but Im done with this game for good. This review is based on my limited playtime 10 hours and beating the final boss 1 time using a Silent armor DOTdebuffcombo deck. Im usually very into card games and strategy games in general, but I just cannot find the motivation to keep playing and learning its strategies. I feel like the combination of rogue like and card game is just not the formula for me. Specifically, I feel that the progression of the game does not feel rewarding to me as a card game or a rogue like game. For a card game,I except to slowly accumulate cardsdecks while expanding my knowledge through theory crafting. Building a deck that I like and can last is 50 of the fun, and the other 50 is from executing such deck.  For Slay the Spire, the accumulation of the cardsdeck only last for a single run, and the accumulation of the knowledge is limited by the game RNG which decides which cards will show up as rewards after every enemy encounter.  Theres no way in the game itself to see all the available cards but only about 3 new cards every battle for the player to increase the deckknowledge. This is really frustration for me, because the only efficient way to learn the cards is to read the game wiki. By only playing the game, theres no way to know if picking card A is better for building a deck than picking card B, because theres no way to have any overview of the synergy between cards or have any knowledge of if a future card belongs to the same architect  without seeing the cards already. The only way to see the cards, sadly, is to read the wiki, or to build a knowingly less optimal deck and hope it works. This learning process really feels like a waste of time for me.     For a rogue like game, I except to have a really engaging game play mechanicstory etc to keep me engaged.The storybackground of Slay the Spire is almost nonexistent. Different card mechanics while they are interesting, I can see a lot of similarities from other popular card games. The dry game play often makes me wonder whats the point of playing other than making myself more familiar with the game. Maybe Ill update my review if I spend more time playing the game, but this is my overall impression for now.P.S. my experience playing card games and rogue like gamesCard gamesHearthstone legend rank season 36, Gwent close beta NA server rank 16, Thronebreaker The Witcher Tale Hard Mode finished.Rogue like gamesHades steam 100 achievement, dead cell final boss beaten,  Rogue Legacy final boss beaten I dont understand why the reviews are so overwhelmingly positive.PositiveThe game is tidy enough and I havent noticed any bugsThere is a good variety of cards and you can play as different characters and of course the challenge is to figure out how to build up a good deck  combine them effectivelyOn some levels it is quick and easy to get into however I do think its a lot tougher than it looks at first glance see belowThe relics and potions give it a further dimension beyond the deck of cardsNegativeI get that you can strategise about what types of cards you accumulate and what types of relics you want to pick up but it still feels to me like if you run into an elite  boss which rolls some repeated high-attack intentions and particularly if you get unlucky in not picking up a lot of blocks or other powerful cards into your hand on those turns then you are struggling....Ive had more than one run where I was doing great then suddenly there is an elite  2 minions intending to hit me with a combined total of 60 attack and I dont have any cards in my hand powerful enough to defend myself or take any of them out on that turn. Im just not really sure how Im supposed to have prepared myself or strategised ahead to deal with being hit with tons more damage than I can realistically block, particularly if Im unlucky with my cards, and particularly when you have to survive multiple fights.For a newbie such as myself I kinda wish there had been some prompts in some instances - to take 2 specific examples, there is one card which automatically ends you turn after you have played it with no reminder and I kept forgetting the end turn mechanic and so inadvertently ending my turn before I had really planned to, and another one which allows you to pick any card from your discard and play it and I kinda assumed that this really does mean I can play any card but it turned out that you still need to meet the preconditions listed on the free card even for a free play. So the game let me play an ineligible card then did a gotcha by telling me, after the event, that Id picked an ineligible card, rather than doing something sensible like greying it out or telling me to make another selection. Thanks, really helpful programming.Some game elements dont see that balanced or well designed for example you can build up Mantra to enter Divinity state however for example one time I did that the only cards left in my hand either ended my turn or exited my stance, and the Divinity stance ends after you finish your turn anyway - and Divinity doesnt seem to do much apart from boost your attack - so the time and effort to get Mantra cards and play them probably bought me about 20 extra damage not very much, for the info of those who have not played. It just seems really underpowered to me - either it should be easier to reach Divinity or it should be longer lasting with more benefits for defence and some extra card draws to make sure you can actually use the stance. Similarly the wrath stance might sound great to inflict some extra damage but in practice because it increases enemy damage so much I landed up barely using it - basically only when I am 100 sure I can exit it this turn or I have a retain card which will allow me to exit whenever I want on a future turn, which made it just feel kinda pointless because I have wrath cards in my deck which I will barely ever use.As far as I can see there is no Undo - I do understand why people might not want to have Undo in their games but again speaking as a beginner learning the game it is pretty frustrating because one misclick or misjudgement can be the end of the run - surely it would be possible to have a mode where at least 1 undo is allowed, particularly if the card played does not reveal any new information, maybe you can disable achievements or whatever if you need to for that mode, I just find it quite irritating to have a single player where Im playing for fun and trying to learn and I literally cant take back a single mistake while Im doing that.You can save and continue your current run, but that is it - you cant create multiple saves or have more than 1 game on the go, as far as I can see. For me this has to be a negative compared to games where there is more flexibility in terms of saving progress and returning to old runsgames if you want to.I think the game needs some more small health boosts because over multiple combats even if you are quite careful and have decent cards etc. your health will inevitably get eroded and there is no way to restore health apart from the very occasional rest options at fires. So I kinda felt like each time my character was suffering a slow painful death because there are so few things you can do to boost your health points so eventually you will just get worn down and die.The difficulty of the enemies seems really scattergun like one run I beat one of the bosses without taking a single point of damage then ran into a succession of really tough regular non-elite enemies and was comprehensively killed. The last enemy on my last playthrough had a limited lifespan but during that time cycled through some increasingly ridiculous attacks and killed me.I dont know if this is just me but I just dont feel the fun in this game, like Im playing it through and its OK but I have not once thought yeah that was fun, I really want to get back to playing it. Ive really just been playing it because the reviews are so positive I feel like I must have missed something.NeutralAlthough there is some variation in the cards, I cant really see a ton of depth, and on a single run theres only so many cards you can gain  upgrade.Maybe more experienced players will tell me Im wrong but I think there is a fair element of luck as honestly youd probably expect with a game like this in terms of which cards you draw each turn, which relics you get offered etc.OverallI originally gave this game a thumbs up as I felt like it was reasonably well made etc but having played it a bit more maybe Im somehow missing the point but I just find it really annoying and not fun at all - basically I just keep getting killed because I dont have enough block to defend against repeated attack intentions, and the number of cards you get dealt every round is quite limited so if you have a round where you just dont have anything particularly good in your hand then Im not sure what you are supposed to do, and I just keep getting ground down by round after round of not having as much block in my hand as the enemy attack value. And honestly looking at the enemies that you have to work through, Im pretty sure if every enemy simply played attack intention every turn then it would be incredibly difficult to win, because with the limited number of cards per hand there are just going to be turns where you dont have enough block and your health will get run down, and even some of the non-boss enemies can have very high attack values. So the only reason that you can make progress at all with this game is that enemies are handicapped by not just being allowed to directly attack you every turn. Maybe more experienced players will tell me that I am missing the correct survival strategies but for me by now Im just annoyed with this game because Ive had many runs where Ive collected what I believe to be a pretty decent set of cards, relics etc and it just isnt enough when I run into the tougher sets of enemies. And the fact that the game doesnt allow you to saveload properly means that if I get killed then the only thing to do is to go right back to the beginning - I cant reload partway through and see if I missed some other approach or something. Theres also some balance things and the lack of ways to top up health points. Ive actually given this game a good few hours and my only feeling really by now is annoyance and a desire to never play it again. I really want to like this game because its overwhelmingly positive with reviews but jeeze, it feels genuinely unfair at times. I finally figured out The Watcher class in order to reach the act 4 final boss and i get obliterated in 2 turns by mechanics ive never seen and damage thats insane.....Usually, i love the cyclical pacing of rogue-likes but every death in Slay the Spire just feels terrible to me. Id rather just go watch a youtube video of what happens after the final boss. Slay the Spire is a pioneer of deckbuilder roguelikes. Maybe not the first to do it, but possibly the most critically acclaimed and well-known. Its created many genre mainstays like the EnemyEliteShopChestBoss map design. And it holds up extremely well compared to similarly aged peers like The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth and Enter the Gungeon. I just didnt like it. It is incredibly fun to backseat watch, and I believe its overall pretty well made, but theres many strange kinks its spiritual successors have hammered out, and I just didnt overall vibe with the playstyle it demands. Pros     There is a mathematically unwinnable win. And yet, no ones actually found it. Theres been pretty close to unwinnable seeds, but even those have been beaten. By all means unless youve made a one of a kind discovery, a loss is purely a skill issue.    Synergy building is fun. Its always a good time doing 200 damage with a Heavy Blade, racking up 10x more Poison than the enemy has health, or beating combat by just mashing End Turn as Defect.    The art design is wonderful. I thoroughly enjoy the painted visual style and orchestral music.    Custom Mode gives you a TON of customization options for how a run can play out, particularly if you just want a pure power fantasy. Though, its segregated from the main intended progression of hiking up the mountain of difficulty.  Toss-Ups     Every action you take matters. Its pretty easy to trace a failed run to one bad turn, one card choice early in the run, or one purchase you didnt make. Many Relics amp this up to a degree I find tedious. Items like Pen Nib doubling the damage of every 10th Attack, or Incense Burner making you invincible every 6 turns. These effects carry between encounters. Many of my runs have been lost to Incense Burner being the wrong number.     Slay the Spire heavily rewards slow play. The more you think on every action you take, the better odds you have of being successful, particularly due to the previous bullet point. Roguelikes typically have a given run time of around 60 minutes. Spire runs can easily drag on to 2 hours 30 minutes. Playing quickly AND well is a very difficult skill to learn.    Theres a default run difficulty, and then 20 Ascension levels after you must clear to beat the game. There are four playable characters, and Ascensions are tracked individually. Clearing everything on the 300 hour mark is feasible, but it may appear tedious to some, particularly if you much prefer one characters playstyle to another.Slay the Spire is very difficult. And many community truisms and guides are outright detrimental to learning. Most of my playtime was hampered by bad advice that was very difficult to unlearn. The playstyles of a high power and low power run are miles apart. I bought this game after watching cool busted crazy flashy runs. What I was met with was a lot of getting garbage cards my first three fights, walking up to the first Elite, and then dying due to lack of damage. On the one hand, you can get a bunch of busted cards and items early, and brainlessly romp through the Spire in about 40 minutes also known as playing Watcher. On the other hand, you can struggle every turn you play, get mostly mediocre power boosts, take the harshest Boss Relics because you have no choice, and barely scrape by after almost 3 hours also known as playing Silent. And the higher the Ascension level, the more likely it is to be the latter. Definitely caught me by surprise.  Cons     Watcher shouldnt exist. Everything else in the game is centered around the three of Ironclad, Silent, and Defect. The Fighter, Thief, and Magician. The three of them represent Attacks, Skills, and Powers, and Red, Green, and Blue respectively.  You can see this trinity of design in the cards they get, relics they get, and even items such as the three Keys. Watcher not only breaks this trinity, she breaks the game. Her typical Stance Dance rotation generates the highest damage and highest energy efficiency of every character while also generating large amounts of block at the same time. 90 of her fights end in one or two turns. Cards such as Tantrum, Talk to the Hand, and Mental Fortress make the supposed glass cannon zero risk, all reward. She sticks out like an overpowered modded OC.     The starting decks are terrible and uninteresting. Every character starts with 4 basic Strikes and 4 Defends. The Ironclad gets an extra Strike. The Silent gets an extra Strike and Defend. This puts them at a disadvantage, since the objective of every run is to remove as many Strikes and Defends as possible because theyre just not worth the energy cost. Theres a Boss Relic called Pandoras Box that replaces all Strikes and Defends with random cards. It is purely beneficial in almost every scenario. Theres an event that upgrades all your Strikes and Defends for free, and you still want to remove them first thing. Curse cards are skipped not because of their downside, but because it means you have to remove a Curse next and not a Strike or Defend. One of the most powerful items is the Peace Pipe, which lets you remove a card Strike or Defend at each campsite. Other deckbuilders solve this by making their basic cards upgrade into far more useful, synergistic things, or simply not having crappy starter decks. Boss Relic design sucks. You gain 3 energy a turn, and spend energy to play cards. Most cards cost 1, but they can cost 0-5, or all your held energy X. Not having 4 energy, or at least a lot of other Gain energy when X Relics  a lot of low cost, high output cards, puts you at a MASSIVE disadvantage. Thus, when you defeat the bosses of Act 1 and Act 2, youre offered to take 1 of 3 selected Boss Relics. Theyre typically Gain 1 more Energy per turn, but X. Such as Runic Domes downside of You can no longer see enemy Intents. Note that there is an enemy whos intent randomly changes each time it is damaged. Or Busted Crowns On Card Reward screens, you have 2 fewer cards to choose from the baseline is 3. You can guess how fun those are. Once, as my first boss reward, I was offered the choice between Runic Dome, Busted Crown, and Ectoplasm Gain 1 Energy at the start of each turn. You can no longer gain Gold. I just quit the run right there. The purely beneficial ones Tiny House, most character specific Boss Relics that arent Watchers are usually just terrible or also exceedingly niche. Or you can just play Watcher, and easily go infinite with just 3 energy.The design of a lot of enemies is exceedingly annoying. I find that many are designed particularly around punishing The Silents playstyle. The Malleable ability makes enemies gain block each time they take damage. The Silent particularly trends towards doing lots of small hits, so this penalizes her much more than The Ironclads few big hits, The Defects purely passive damage, and The Watchers lots of big hits. Thorns is the same thing, but you take damage when you damage the enemy. One of the most infamous Elites is Gremlin Nob, an enemy who deals more damage every time you play a Skill Card. Guess which character is the most Skill focused. In general, every single enemy will either flee, or infinitely scale up in damage dealt to encourage killing enemies quickly, and discourage mostly blocking and slowly chipping away at the enemy, or at least stalling that simply blocks too little. You would not believe what The Silents playstyle is based around.I nonetheless recommend Slay the Spire to anyone who does want a slow, highly thought focused strategic experience Watcher is excluded from this. I just lack the patience for it. A total waste of time. Too much RNG dependent. The further difficulties you go, the more limited builds that are viable for a victory run. Dont be like me, with this much time already spent you can play so many other games and enjoy more different experiences. Positive reviews does not mean it will be good for you personally, not for me obviously and I learned it the hard way. The true ending of the game ruins the entire game. Deck building - rather drafted or constructed - is about a playful expression. You work with a range of cards to explore interactions around themes, playstyles, or mechanics. If you build a deck like that in Slay the Spire, you cannot defeat the final boss. How Slay the Spire wants you to build your deck is to be able to produce X damage and X armor each and every turn. No deck you build can forgo these things. What this amounts to is that the only viable deck is a good stuff deck, a collection of cards above the normal damagearmor curve. This is incredibly dull and goes against the joy of deck building.There are free variations of this format that are better. There are older and newer takes that do it better, digital and physical, harder and more casual. Theres 0 reason to play Slay the Spire. I love this game enough to have purchased it for my phone, my tablet, and my PlayStation. The art is great. The card mechanics are great. The characters are great. There is a lot of greatness, here. The reason for the negative review is because the game is unbalanced. At the end of the day, yes, it is possible to make it through to A20, kill the heart, etc. Its just not consistent enough to be enjoyable. You will have SO many runs feeling you have been careful, planned your route, taken enough block, balanced your attack, grabbed the right relics, and you will STILL get smacked for 63 dmg. People try to say the game is not based on RNG and that you have a lot of control over the game.You do not. Understanding that not every card is going to be S tier, but certain combinations are required to make it past certain bosses and youre rarely going to get to construct those decks. What is the point of having certain card mechanics if theyre never going to be viable. Looking around online it seems that there is 1 particular run that is unwinable. Why?Its a fun game and sometimes it feels great. Its just too disheartening. Ive wanted to like this game for so long but, its just, not very well designed. The game design tells you one thing and then forces you to do something else. Casual fun decks are punished, you have to make optimal decks. Youre forced to forgo fun cards and builds because youll be slammed into the ground most of the time if you dont make The Right Deckon top of that, RNG can just screw you over, the way the defensive cards work is just frustrating because you can do things like get all attack cards on a turn when the enemy is winding up a huge attack, or get a handful of block cards on a turn where your opponent is doing nothing. These moments arent interesting, theyre just annoying. I dont feel like I built my deck wrong I feel like the game just decided I should suffer in a way that was beyond my control.I get why people like this game, but Im not a spike, I make decks to do cool stuff, not to be optimized. Its just not for people like me, as much as I want it to be Game is highly overrated. Its your standard card-based rougelike. Nothing special about it and gets boring fast.Its not a bad game, if you like card based rougelike, you probably like this one too. its just nothing special at all.edit gave it another 10 hours because they said it will get better, nope, it doesnt. 15h in and it is exactly the same as the first run. I want steam to have a 3rd option for neutral reviews but this is the next best thing to say how I feel about STS.So, to start I dont particularly dislike the game and as a matter of fact I love deck building and I love rogue likes so I wouldve imagined this game being a dream come true. However, for all the nearly 300 hours of time I spent playing, I didnt really have as good of a time as I wouldve expected.Despite me loving deck builders, doesnt really mean Im particularly good at them so this game expects you to bring your very best knowledge of building a deck as you go along through a run as well as relics and other things.So going off of that, and my lack of skill when it comes to card games Ive only ever won about roughly 30 runs out of over 1000 which is clearly an abysmal winrate.I am not 100 blaming the game for this obviously, but it goes to show it is extremely punishing when making mistakes or by favoring a certain playstyle which goes against the grain of what this game expects. All in all, this review is mostly me complaining about my severe issue in skill but overall the game is a solid game for deck building and nails roguelike elements in such a nice way which is why I ended up playing so much despite losing over and over. I just wouldve liked if there was a little less RNG involved in card draw during a fight or when picking new cards.for people that like the challenge this offers, then I would wholeheartedly recommend it despite my own personal problems with playing. maybe its just not for me, since it DOES get frustrating after a while of trying different things and I still cant win against most scenarios.",
        "summary": "The biggest problem for me is that very little carries over from each turn. This makes it feel like there isnt much I can do to prepare for future turns. Losses often felt hopeless and wins often felt undeserved, often because of the cards or relics you get to pick up in the ea."

Its not an RPG  its a choice-and-consequence adventure game that allows for some freedom, but generally is relatively linear.Still, its a must-play for any players interested in traditional Russian mythology, that it explores on a level unusually deep for video games. Folktale logic mixes heathen beliefs with Christianity and good with evil, confusing saints with powerful spirits and making morality grey in a distinctly unique way.Imps are people with personality, and theyre not evil by choice  its just that their nature makes them incapable of doing good. Theyre eager to work, but the work they do always ends up being harmful. As a witch, you must take imps into your service, but theyre demanding more work, so you have to send them off to curse people and destroy crops. Does that make you good or evil? The answer is both  you are the source of evil in the local lands, but youre also the person who thus obtains the power to make a difference and help people. Its an extremely compelling status, explored deeply by the game.And so it makes a lot of sense that diplomacy, winning in cards normal cards, a la gwint, solving verbal riddles, and fights become interchangeable methods of dealing with demons. Theyre not really your enemies and folktale logic often values trickery and cunning more than sheer power. The relationship between humans and imps is half-symbiosis, half cruel game, but its hardly a war.This duality is oddly mirrored by the games narrative that mixes a fictional story with actual folktales as written down by folklorists  and with scientific commentary on myhtology and folk beliefs. The game both shows and analyzes mythic archetypes, and none of that is done in a heavy-handed info-dump-y way, as the tidbits are short and relevant to the story. Its surprisingly informative without breaking immersion.And that, I think, is what sells the game for me the most.Im not sure how well it translates in the international version, and I played in Russian. While the linguistic stylization is not perfect, its still extremely compelling, with characters using dialectisms that deepen the immersion. I think its a must-play for anyone who cares and is interested in the Russian culture.Do play it. Its worth it.Not to mention the amount of content is quite impressive for an indie!P. S. And yes, while the idea isnt exactly new, I still get the chills whenever anyone explores the idea that the XXth century was forged in hell, because it was. Overall yes Id recommend the game. Great stuff 1.  A lot of Slavic folklore, cool tales and mythical creatures such as mermaid, leshiy, werewolves etc2. Good story line and variety in endings3. Characters you can sympathise with, nice voice acting4. A lot of variety in choices, you can fight an enemy or try to persuade them or even play cards with them to have it your way keep a close eye on details, if you choose correctly you can avoid a lot of fights!5. Cool sin mechanic, ordering devils around is kinda nice6. Card game - played it  a lot in my childhood, really easy and fun game but beware sometimes opponents may cheat, especially supernatural folk7. Nice puzzles - when you have to win in few rounds or under other conditions8. Interesting fights - a lot of variety with cards. I generally dislike card games but this one is somewhat interestingNot so great stuff1. Save system is bad, you cant save before an important choice and then load game and try again if you failed. You get rolled back quite a bit sometimes. I do recommend however to save before each location just in case.2. Moving is cumbersome at times.. I had my character get stuck in terrain many times. Or I couldnt move out of some corner3. Graphics... The game design is quite interesting, however it feels unfinished. Like textures for the models were drafted and this is how they went into production.. Specifically during cut scenes - its just ugly in my view. Some monsters look better than the others. 4. Some chapters feel more long than the others, and feel somewhat boring. Would be nice if it progressed a bit faster.Another thing is - localisation.. Im lucky to be fluently speaking few languages. Dont get me wrong, English localisation is very good, however the expression and the feel of some conversations is very different to the original. Its more flat and emotionless than in Russian if that makes sense. One of the reasons is using a lot of words and expressions from predecessor language. Another reason is words that just cannot be ideally mapped to English words. Again, English localisation is great, but if you can understand Russian Id recommend switching to it. Finished one thorough playthrough in 36.5 hrs over 3 days mind you, which is very close to my playthrough of Thronebreaker 35.4 hrs. Accomplished 4450 achievements, but steam did not record 2 which I think were during an update. You can probably do it faster if you dont gamble too much with Durak lol.What is it? Rating 810- Think Witcher Thronebreaker format of play, but as Yennefer instead of Geralt Sorcerer. You traverse the wildsrural farms of turn of the century industrial Russia, where superstition and god fearing folk are rampant. You provide shaman-esque services whilst pursuing your quest to see your beloved husband who had passed. Game mechanics and Lore are what hooks you in. Middling voice acting and artwork. Needs improvement on UIsome card tweaks.GOOD  LoreWritingStory and consistency Some very interesting insights into Russian folklore which I presume are well researched by the developers not that I can really call out inaccuracies. Basically, everything morally considered bad has a Chort Demon behind it, unseen by humans other than Koldun sorcerers. The clashing systems of belief between modern industrial Tsar Russia and rural life are prevalent here. The Story as a whole is consistent, and while straightforward, is written well and as engaging as Thronebreaker IMO. Decisions Something that is usually overlooked, but the game does allow you to fail non-essential tasks. I actually like this since the minor decisions are reflected way later in the game in a mostly meaningful way. Most new games tend to baby the player into making decisions, but Blackbook does give you room to make choices, moral or not except for the main story ofc. CombatDeck building system Appears shallow at the start, with limited customization, but builds open up once about 13   through the game. Once the reins are off, you can pretty much build whatever silly deck you want up to a 33 deck limit. The card mechanics are engaging enough to hook you once you get the hang of it, similar to Gwent. Durak a minigame cardgame in a cardgame game is VERY frustrating at first as the rulesvideos are not exactly clear, but once it starts to click, it is additive. By endgame, I still managed to hold my own against demons with no cheating.- Extra tip My midgameendgame deck were pretty much status effect builds WasteCurse as the speed at which you can rack up both offencedefence is insanely quick. I switched from a waste deck as someone called EZ mode to a CurseBlessed combo deck for extra spicy memes, reaching 3000 damage in a single turn.- Extra tip Developers did not put too much emphasis on Knowledge Skill tree and you can pretty much survive 34 of the game with midgame cards with little invested in the combat skill trees.MIDDLE  IMPROVEMENT Voice acting English The game is fully voiced acted in ALL scenes and you can tell work went into it, but the tonecharacter matching is sometimes really off that it feels like the Devs pulled the nearest available person from the street to voice a character. You could very well say some characters were the same VA trying his very best to mimic a sound that he does not make naturally lol. - What irks me sometimes is that you have a switch between a really good Russian local accent, to a UK slang Russians use the word lad? and it feels off. A recommendation here for future titles is to consider a primary language to save costs, and just do an excellent job matching characters once. IMO, I read most of the text anyway, and wouldnt mind a stronger Russian VA experience to increase immersion. ArtworkScenery To be honest, this looks like a Unity game, with low poly characters and really basic scenery. What is strange is that the 2D elements CardsMap are really well done, with its own unique vibe. I can understand that the costs to do every scenearea in the style of 2D drawings are probably higher than the 3D jank.- Recommendations for the future Id actually say that the game will elevate to an easy 910 with upgraded full 2D elements like Thronebreaker or Darkest dungeon instead of a hybrid 2D3D format. I think that the lore allows the artists to really come up with great designs, and this is a game which can benefit from true artistic creativity. NEEDS IMPROVEMENT- TranslationsCard texts This may be a result of localizationtranslation into English, but Ill split the improvements into 3 partsA. Translations The LoreFolklore stories that you use to make educated guesses to questions are actually not intuitive and a bit hard to comprehend. I did like the help text highlights for both the card texts and general subtitles, they really help alot. IE Somewhere in the story, there was a fiery serpant type demon, and I had absolutely no idea where it came from or what it was, despite our character having the knowledge to answer the question. IMPROVEMENT Could consider putting in a Bestiary based on what your main character has learned over the years. For undiscovered enemiesdemons, you could put a general description of what they do so that it is easier to reference than folklore tales. B. Card texts This could be a translation issue, but sometimes the hard descriptions on cards are difficult to accurately determine what they do and in what order. IMPROVEMENT Help texts do assist here, but I only found them useful for explaining the text itself, and not the order at which it is executed. Consider adding a Game Board explanation to explain order of status effects and executions andor add examples of how a card is played as a tooltip.C. MAP This is a minor quality of life recommendation, but a prompt that tells you Please finish your exploration, this is a point of no return would be extremely useful on the map where the final destination is not the end of the map.- IE Due to the way autosave works, once you hit the end area scenario of the map, you cannot return to the previous areas to finish exploring if you missed anything. You will then have to reload a prior manual save, and that can be quite far behind. Its definitely worth it as a journey into the Slavic folk lore and culture, but the game itself might be a bit on the weak side. Grab this for for the unique setting, story and culture that youll experience, but dont expect the next Slay the Spire.The core gameplay is centered around deck building. Unfortunately, its neither very creative nor balanced. I would strongly recommend playing the game on easy  to enjoy more of the environment, rather than spending too much time playing one identical battle after another. Bosses and puzzle encounters can definitely be interesting, but 90 of the time you re just applying the same strategy over and over. Often you even end up dragging the combat out longer in order to use healing cards. Health does not reset between encounters.One of the key gameplay elements is answering lore related questions. As some reviewers have pointed out, the game does not explain the lore before you may need to apply it. In such events, dont be ashamed to reload the save after failing.Being in a good position to compare original Russian and the English localisation, I can say that its unfortunately rather mediocre. It sounds like English voice actors really didnt have any context for the lines, so they often sound out of place. Thats even a problem with Russian voice, but not to such an extent. The translation is not amazing either. It really couldve used some QA and polish. Having some chiorts at your disposal is a key gameplay mechanic. While there is no direct translation, it does not help the player when they are referred to as chiorts, devils, gremlins or demons interchangeably when specifically explaining the mechanics.There is a game feature that highlights key words in a conversation that might need explaining. This helps in Russian because a lot of the words and terms are archaic. Its also great for localisation because it gives translators an opportunity to explain additional things as well. Unfortunately, it appears underutilised and often shows inattention. Highlighting Leshiy in text and giving an explanation for Leshy is an example of where both are valid, but someone shouldve made a Style Guide and had some QA run over it.Running Russian voiceover along with English subtitles shows that English may not have been working with the final version of the text. Some names and events dont quite match. Its not a translation mistake  because you wouldnt accidentally translate Mother as Natasha.Finally, while the English translation is overall well written, it shows some errors in understanding of the Russian meaning. A lot of the nuance in this game is about old superstitions. If you dont quite understand what its about, you end up with translations that make sense, but miss the point. An example would be translating vampires cant cross a river as vampires cant swim. It might make sense, it might work in the context of events, but something important got lost.Despite some localisation issues, I would still strongly recommend this game. It may have been the best effort so far to bring the Russian folk lore to the western audiences. I look back now and see how much time I spent on this game.This one is going to a be a bit hit or miss and really depends on your personal tastes, I personally loved this as I have an understanding of Russian folklore and I have family in Yugoslavia which gave me a bit of personal stake and understanding.This game is in essence a card based deck builder RPG with very light elements of exploration and an emphasis on decisions and dialogue with the main character throughout the course of the game being bale to collect a fair amount of lore. This gets presented in 2 formats with one being excerpts of folk tales to the more direct breakdowns of the cultural beliefs and folklore that was the spiritual centre of the Russian peasant of the time.Before we even get to the game I enjoyed the heck out of this. Russian folklore is some of the more intricate and overlooked in general beside things like  LOOK, THE TSAR HAS A BEEEEG HAT AND A SILO FULL OF VODCHKA!!!!!.The game play in of itself is fairly amusing but nothing ground breaking though it does make effort to change things up and i will say that the the boss fights are pleasantly challenging.The story and especially the visuals late game are pretty damn beautiful even though the graphics are basic.This game feels like one of those where the devs had a dream that they brought into reality against the odds and i can only imagine as I have to have done so often how epic this would have been with the budget that gets thrown into so many unfinished AAA cash cows.810- Slav magic A love letter to slavic folklore I bought Black Book due to its theme I find slavic folklore and pagan traditions in general deeply captivating, but I hadnt much expectations for what seemed at first glance like a small indie game coasting on personality alone. What I did not expect is how much I would love every aspect of this game. Theme and general ambiance First of all, it is a game made with heart and it absolutely shows, its oozing with the charm of the modest and hardy life of older, rural cultures and their countless traditions, beliefs and superstitions.Playing as a witch, the player will be in constant contact with such customs and have a particular insight into the surrounding mythology, at the frontier of the real and supernatural. Black Book also does a great job depicting the blurring of the lines between orthodox faith and pagan spirituality, from its world and dialogues all the way to its combat system and itemization.The game has an encyclopedia feature where articles of knowledge and lore can be stored as the player collects them on their travels. From real tidbits of local culture or history to tales and legends, the game is a true treasure trove to those who like to take the time to read and learn about a culture where reality and superstition are interwoven, influencing each other in every aspect of daily life.  Visuals Although some might be put off by the low-poly 3D phases of the game namely while exploringinvestigating an area or during combat I think the game truly shines during the visual-novel-like dialogues, which uses a hand-drawn style not unlike one of a story book, bringing details and personality to the characters while remaining simple and humble enough, just like the folks it portrays. In battle, the pagescards imitate the style of illustrations one could find accompanying the stories of old or on religious iconography, further reinforcing the omnipresence of this liminal atmosphere, halfway between the world of men and the spiritual realms. Sound design In the audio department, the game once again shows sobriety but not austerity the music and sound effects convey emotions effectively, remaining in the background without taking the spotlight. The deep, low-intensity music or sometimes lack thereof is perfect to explore a forest at night with only the wind and rustling of leaves for company whereas the combat soundtrack brings percussions, drumming in the intensity of battling an evil spirit.I must say what truly sold me on the game were the songs that can be collected just like encyclopedia entries. It might be very niche interest but I absolutely love traditional slavic folk music with or without instruments, monodic or polyphonic, ukrainian, polish, russian or any other origin it doesnt matter and the unexpected delight of finding a dozen of such acapella songs, very well performed in the traditional white voice technique, is what made this game so special to me.I must give a special mention to the russian voice acting, which consistently hits the nail when it comes to tone and delivery I dont speak the language yet I could feel the context-appropriate emotion or feeling in every line.Note English voices are also available and I was surprised to see one could freely toggle between English - Russian - None silent at any time without having to reload the game. Combat gameplay I consider the turn-based card battles to be the main gameplay loop of the game, since the rest consists mainly of conversations, making text-based choices, moving rather linearly between areas and interacting with item vendors. Not that its devoid of interest, far from it - but most of the meat is in the combat system.Mechanically, I would say there are enough different mechanics to be interesting without becoming too confusing, and effect descriptions are correctly worded for the most part.Early on it is a bit too simplistic and limited but with each chapter of the story, a new collection of cards is unlocked, allowing for more diverse and complex strategies as the game progresses. Also, the player can complement their decks with a wide array of consumables and permanent items, some improving certain effects, or granting stats while others can apply effects at the start of battle, for example. In the same vein, there is a companion system which is basically a cooldown-driven, on-demand buff, the nature of which depends on the chosen companion.I must say I was surprised with the build diversity and viability on Normal difficulty, also the game allows the player to save up to 3 decks, which is nice to play around with deckbuilding. Here are examples of decks I personally used to great effect, to give you an idea of what is possible a slow-ramping deck relying on stacking damage and defense buffs to egregious levels --  an attrition deck based around debuffing enemy attacks into oblivion and applying damage-over-time with a few trump cards scaling their damage on enemy debuffs -- a weird deck thats all about self-inflicted damage to trigger effects, and massive healinglifesteal to compensate -- a deck based around increasing how many cards can be played per turn and using cards that get stronger the more cards of the same color are played.There are other mechanics I can imagine building around, but havent experimented with.The game features a handful of puzzle battles as well, which are encounters where you have no items, no companion and a fixed deck to find the one sometimes few play order to solve the battle. I found them interesting and creative, often forcing you out of the comfort of your deck to discover new ways to play, but I can understand that voiding player progress even if only for the time of one battle can be frustrating to some people.Finally, Black Book also offer an optional regular card game of Durak that can be played with peasants and sometimes demons or spirits. It can be fun for a while, especially since the player and sometimes the more occult-inclined opponents can employ a couple of sorcerous tricks to cheat. Conclusion I cannot overstate the amount of heart and soul that radiates from this game, and even though I am very biased in its favor due to how well it resonates with my personal interests, I know it is not necessarily a game for everyone due to its slower pace, weird-working save feature think manual saves that just send you back to the beginning of the current area without saving progress or inventory changes made within the area  and minimalist 3D.However, if you are even somewhat remotely interested in slavic folklore, or more generally in the sort of themes I have described, please do yourself a favor and give Black Book a chance. It is a proper Russian witcher experience. A deep dive in Russian Slavic mythology. A rare chance to learn about Russian cryptic critters originating from a unique mix of archaic believes and Russian Orthodox Christianity. The game is actually made very well. The only downside is English translationvoiceover missing a lot of flavor textfacts. A most likely made to cater to western audience but also cutting away projects appeal It is 1010 from me Its fun and the game is pretty easy in the standard difficulty not even close to beating it after 8hours of play.The combat plays like a really simplified version of Heartstone no mana, but there are different card types. Its a bit like The Spire or Rogue Adventure on mobile, but with more dialogue and puzzles. Wow, a real gem of Russian gamedev. Nice to see that not all talented developers have been sucked into making some grindathon crap for Mail.ru!I am not typically into CCGs and I bought this because of the folklore, which I always found interesting. Russian folklore is very unique due to being a cocktail of many different ethnicities and cultures, but unfortunately much of it has been destroyed by the Orthodox church and then by communists. Furthermore, a lot of the documentation was written on bark which is not a very durable material. As a result this kind of information is rarely available in an easy to consume format. However, if you do bother to learn some of it, I think this game proves what fertile ground it is for building game worlds. Black Book really nails the atmosphere and I have to give special praise for the fantastically written dialogue that captures several dialects, as well as old Russian speech and the difference between peasant speech and that of educated people at the end of 19th century. This was also an interesting time when technology started to find its way to the villagers, which too was played out cleverly in this game. Unfortunately you cant quite appreciate the brilliant writing if you dont know Russian as the English translation practically erases all the nuances of different dialects. Nevertheless, its a good translation and you will still be able to enjoy the games very well-written and paced plot with it. Voice work is also excellent in both Russian and English, though at times in the Russian VO, I could tell the actors got confused by the pre-revolution dialect and didnt quite match the intended tonality.As for gameplay - I think it was fun. As much as any CCG is for me. The cards are very well designed, they enable a lot of viable and varied builds, and the further you progress the more complex and powerful card effects you can unlock. However the deck building has many QoL issues - for example you cant empty your deck fully to rebuild it, you cant view all cards in one list have to switch sections, the thumbnails are way too big and the previews are too big also, you cant restart the battle to change the deck without dying first and there are a lot of situations where your current build simply doesnt work against certain enemies.If I had to pick an actual problem with the game, Id say its the graphics. Especially the character portraits. Its clear from other art in the trailers and in the games portrait gallery in one of the levels, that the games artists can draw well. However when it comes to the most important portraits - the dialogue portraits, I feel that theyve slacked off. The protagonist herself, especially, looks kinda ugly, the lack of proper shadows make her different-colored eyes look like she has strabismus.Overall Black Book is a really good game with fun gameplay, good story, interesting world and a good value the full game  all side-quests takes 40 of quality hours to complete. And if you are also intersted in Russian folklore its pretty much the only such product on the market. 100 recommended. The game is like Slay The Spire but with an actual well writen and voiced plot and minus the rogue-like elements. The story is good and the game contains lots of real Russian folklore. There are several original and interesting game mechanics such as demon managing you must choose if you will send your demons to harass other people or suffer their debuffs or find ways to mitigate their penalties and puzzle combat. There is lots of room for roleplaying choices to become a good or bad witch. And there are many options for builddeck customization. The only cons of the game are minimalistic graphics this didnt stop Slay The Spire from being a great game and that the difficulty is rather easy even on the extreme setting. I would also love if the sin system had more interactions with the game play than simply affecting some dialogue and the endings. Maybe some item or card interactions would be great. Or maybe i havent gotten that far. This game is the most enjoyable experience Ive had in gaming for a really long time.Before I say anything else, if you dont enjoy turn-based or card games you wont enjoy the gameplay here. That being said, here are my thoughts for what theyre worth! Others have covered the premise of the game in nice detail already! However, I will say that the level of attention to Russian folklore remains incredible even halfway through the game. The music that is in the game is beautiful and a sincere joy to come across! Despite some of the more low fidelity scenes owing to the graphics style the entire game still oozes with charm.If youre even the slightest bit interested in Russian religion and folklore, this game is for you! I rarely if ever buy supporter packs and the like, but I happily got it for this game.So much love to the developer! Dear Lord Yes. Incredible music. A hell of a story of Russian Folklore. Great Art Style. Above all that A really fun and well thought out card gamedeck builder on top. That ending though. Whew. Its so great to see games that really stick the landing. Im putting this one near Inscryption for What deckbuilders can be. Black Book is a game about Slavic folklore with a deckbuilding turn-based gameplay, so whats the big deal about it? the game creates such an intense story-telling and atmosphere that will draw you into it, and you will immerse in the world designed for youthe game is fully voice-acted hearing all these old Russian words being actually spoken makes a huge difference in terms of immersiontheres a huge depth to its lore ,explore and reading them is really intresting  leshen in witcher 3 is here for example plenty of actions with consequences, moral choices and different ways of solving the problemscharacters are all mysterious and worth your time to speak with all of themso after all I love this game, and its a 8.510 for me recommended As a Slav myself, Im more than delighted to play a slavic mythology game done right! Ive always been very interested in the mythos of my cultural heritage and its such a breath of fresh air to see them represented in the video game ganre as well. I fell in love with this game the moment I started playing and it keeps on being even better. Thank you so much! Pros  - Very immersive- Underrepresented mythos - Enjoyable storyCons  - Buggy. Movement, where it is possible, can be quite difficult in some areas, and at best counterintuitive. Restart Battle will not fully reset some states, in such a way that you can unexpectedly lose puzzle battles if you have forfeited early after noticing a mistake. Some dialogues lines were forgotten in translation and are still in russian. - Some features of the game are poorly distributed along its length, such as battle puzzles . Page creation makes book merchants rather obselete. Items are a hit-or-miss, either making your deck rely on abundant usage of items, or forget about them entirely , until you meet that one boss who was designed specifically against your deck type which makes you spam items .TLDR  Is it enjoyable ? Yes, but it lacks polish Is it unique ? In terms of storytelling, yes.Is it worth it ? Not at this price. There are better indie games that cost half what this game costs . I got it on sale and still feel like I paid too much. Id slice the price in half. If youre just starting this game, I highly recommend that you turn on English subs and change the audio to Russian. I appreciate the effort put in by the English dubbers who I think are the same ones doing the Russian version, but the accent and the mispronounced words can throw you off. Besides, the acting is just so much better in the actors native tongue. The only other thing thats not good is the camera and how it pans. Sometimes, you have to make your character run to the edge of the screen and when the camera zooms out or moves around to show you where shes going, it can get disorienting. I got trapped in a house for about 30 seconds trying to get out of this loop.Other than that, its an amazing game. I love it. I love the background stories, Russian folklore. You may read about this game being text-heavy. Dont let it discourage you because its worth it reading everything. Wow, this game is really something. Its unbelievably faithful to Slavic folklore and mythology. The setting itself is really cool with a lot of historical accuracy too. Music fits the theme beautifully and includes some folk music too. The combat is pretty easy but tbh I think most people would play this game for the story and setting rather than gameplay. Too early to comment on the story itself but its looking very interesting with some really cool characters. My single only gripe is that the English voice acting is a bit....Off...Its not bad, but the intonation and writing seems to flow better in Russian, I think the voice actors for both English and Russian may be the same for a lot of characters, too. Id highly recommend setting the voice acting to Russian if you understand the language or want to learn it. This game is amazing! 10 hours in so far. - no bugs- well-written story- engaging combat- balanced cards system- great visual and music - and Its Slavs!Seriously, try this game out. Its one of the best rpg I have played in 2021. You can really tell when something is a passion project.. This game is a beautiful blend of history, culture, mythology, religion and storytelling, with fantastic and addicting gameplay and full of heart. I was completely involved in the story and loved learning more about the lore as we went. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, I always stopped to let new songs play fully. Overall a great experience. Definitely worth your time and money. It is an excellent game with a few minor quality of life issues.The Good It is a very accessible game. The story and mechanics are well built. The music is incredible, and the setting, lore, and atmosphere all respect and honor to the culture of the people it portrays. The gambling mini-game Durak is incredibly fun, and I probably sunk about a quarter of my game time into just playing that.The Bad The English voice acting is not great. I ended up changing the dialogue to russian, cause it sounds better. The mechanical interaction is not always as good as it could be. The game has trouble tracking what the output of damage and guard will be when you actually run the turn. It also does not convey some information about mechanics or item effects very well, but that may be a translation issue. Also, it does not tell you specifically what killed you when you die. This is mainly an issue in the roguelike mode, where you dont get to redo battles. At one point, three cycles into a run, I died immediately upon hitting the send button. I have no idea what killed me, and no idea how I could have avoided it. Thats a huge turn off in a game like this. The good far outweighs the bad, and you might not even notice the things I complain about. I would say, to hold off on picking up the DLC until youre sure you will want to play it.",
        "summary": "Imps are people with personality, and theyre not evil by choice  its just that their nature makes them incapable of doing good. As a witch, you must take imps into your service, but theyre demanding more work, so you have to send them off to curse people and destroy crops."

        "text": "I am still on edge between nay or yay, been switching the directions of those thumbs for a while. My main difficulty to truly recommend this is the disconnect between the atmosphere of the lore and worlds artwork. While the Slavic folklore is intricate and filled with various spirits, traditions  and rules, the minimalistic world, where they are supposed to live in, feels empty with few herbs scattered around. But dont get me wrong, it aint a baaaaad game. It has great lore and deck building mechanism is very well done, kudos for that. If you enjoy reading short stories and card battles, go ahead with checking out the game. For me it needed that extra special setting of overall world atmosphere, which would piece everything together as one. It is a shame. The cultural and historical aspects of this game are fantastic. Ethnic songs are super cool too. BUT in some levels it is impossible to play because of bugs. Your character cannot go where it suppose to, she was constantly stuck half way. Levels werent properly tested I dropped it in the end because i was so tired of this bugs. unfortunatly, will have to watch the rest of the game on youtube.I hope that developers will do something about it I would love to recommend this game, as I do enjoy the strategy of the card playing. Even though the work of Old Igors house and the chorts is a bit tedious, I dont even mind that. What I DO mind is that if youre not paying attention and go to the zone of the main quest, you cannot backtrack and finish optional areas you missed accidentally. For some reason, the autosave saves over the same slot over and over, so you cannot reload back to the previous area even. You cannot alter the way the autosaves work in any way to address this limitation. There also is rather limited choice, really, because there are obvious correct answers. Attempting to deviate from being the one-way good witch leaves you with less experience and more sin to manage, which becomes so overly burdensome that doing anything else becomes game-limiting. And honestly, the cutscene graphics are so unpolished that it makes me wonder why so much of the game is structured into cutscenes? The rest of the game has far better aesthetic, so it seems like an odd choice.I DO love the lore, as I wasnt familiar with a lot of the folk knowledge presented in this game. The game is story-heavy, but I didnt find the reading to be dense or long like, say, Disco Elysium.This game might be worth it on good sale, just be aware of the enjoyment-limiting annoyances built into the game. I was very torn about whether to give this a thumbs up or a thumbs down. I think it heavily depends on how patient you are about jank. If you really love to read about folklore, that could also redeem the game for you.The card mechanics are interesting, but balancing is an issue. Most mob battles are extremely easy. Bosses are a mixed bag. Either quite tedious if they happen to be immune to your status affliction of choicedish out a status affliction every round or extremely easy if you equip one trinket to cancel out their gimmick. Sure, customizing your deck for a boss should indeed make it easier, but if you just need to swap one thing out, it feels trivial. And if this was intentional, it seriously lacks quality of life management. You cant change your deck after the fight has started. But youre allowed to, after you die. At the same time youre allowed to restart a battle anytime, but restarting alone doesnt allow you to change decks. So if you want to adapt to the boss , youll need to die or reload the whole scene to change your deck in the dialogue before the battle start.The movement of the protagonist can be janky as hell. She barely has any awareness of her surroundings, so you need to be careful that no people or little ledges are between her and the point you want to guider her to, otherwise shell just continuously run against her obstacle. Then theres times where shell start running in a different direction or even in circles before she actually goes for the spot you marked with your mouse. Sometimes you can stand directly next to a herb but the prompt to pick it wont appear until she stands in a specific spot you have to figure out with finicky clicking.  A lot of times she also only strolls languidly to a spot instead of running to it.Thats all a little irritating in the overall game but wasnt much of an issue because there was no time sensitive events. Until a section towards the end, which honestly played quite a big part on why I ultimately gave a thumbs down. Its your run of the mill obvious spotlight searching for the player minigame. You just need to behind some pillars while the spotlight pans back and forth before moving to the next pillar. Except the janky movements largely stayed the same as before so Vasilisia would usually still walk slowly while she was supposed to dart from cover to cover. And quite often she wouldnt stand still behind the cover but walk past the point you clickedwalk circles and right into the spotlight. This section killed me more times than all battles combined. It was so fucking frustrating, Im still a little salty about it.The folklore excerpts were cool, but if you open the tab for that, itll automatically change the order of the excerpts and open an unread one, which will mark it as read. If you accidentally click out ofon the tab, it can be hard to keep track on which ones you have actually already read. I wish there was an option to only mark excerpts as read if I mark them myself, I usually like reading lore in batches as stopping to read for every single excerpt ruins the game flow for me. While theres a lot of stories, they dont cover all the necessary knowledgefolkloretraditions needed to answer all riddles. pretty cool at first but repetitive as fuck and the gameplay lacks a lotta depth, just replay slay the spire or something thats good. Also easy as fuck, i dont think i lost once I did somewhat enjoy the game and I wish there was a neutral option. The good is that we explore an underrepresented mythology rooted in slavic russian folklore, so learning about it through piecing bits of information around the story was great.I like the card game battle mechanics too, just been a fan of card games all my life and I like ones that have a story and are more than just PvP or Roguelike.However, there are issues-The story has its twists and turns, but there are over 100 characters apparently, and its quite difficult to keep track of everyone. I lost a bit of interest towards the end.-The 3D point-and-click section is really poor and janky. The puzzles are really not difficult and you find everything you need in the same or adjacent rooms. Could have been skipped I think.-Every one of the books 7 seals unlocks basically another expansion of cards. However, they still remain black or white, with no distinction not even a symbol. Doesnt feel like you unlock new content, which could have been visually represented in some ways.And this would have been all right, except for the biggest sin of this game-no balancing. Yeah, the game gets too easy. After about a quarter of a game, it stopped being challenging. Due to no deckbuilding restrictions, and you can make a very concentrated deck of 13 cards you can have up to 33, but I cannot see a reason why you would, you have some combos that at first deal 100 damage in one turn, then you can scale to obscene levels doing 600, 100 damage through different strategy like cursing the enemies, or buffing your multi-attack cards, or stacking a lot of defense, doubling it four times, and then bonking the enemies with it.I believe that a game that has card battles at its core should be challenging. It should encourage you to explore multiple strategies, die many times and trying different ways around different opponrnts. Having said that, if you are on the fence and dont mind cruising through the story, its still somewhat enjoyable and satisfying. The soundtrack is good, the voice acting suffers a bit but its passable. I would rate this a solid 510. This game was very hard to rate. The problem is that it does a few things very well, and some other things not so much.I really like the unique take on the RPG deckbuilder genre. There are lots of cool mechanics in place that you unlock quite early in ur adventure.The sad thing is, most of these things turn into a boring, slow and repetative grind.After killing 100 enemies the same way, sending ur minions on 100 boring tasks, speaking to 100 boring villagers, it gets pretty stale.So id give the first 3-4 hours of this game 810. The next 10 hours a 510. The final 1-2 hours are cool, 810.Overall 610.I think most people agree with mee, looking at the steam achievements.Lots of people finish the prologue and 1st chapter. Very few people finish this game, even though it aint hard. People just get bored.So why negative recommend at a 610 rating? Because currently it stands on 95 positive, which is absurdly high for a 610 game, so my rating makes the total score more realistic. Overall this is a good game, but not good enough for me to recommend to others. The game is lacking some polish and has balance issues. Some of the voice actors are downright awful and the dialogue doesnt make sense in some areas. I think the game would have been better without voice acting and just text. I started playing on the experienced difficulty level and it was great for the first couple hours. Then the boss fights got insanely difficult suddenly and I had to lower the difficulty to the easiest setting, where I still only barely scraped by. Then all the non-bosses were way too easy, so I re-upped the difficulty. And it kept flipping back and forth. Unfortunately I wont be finishing this game. But Im absolutely thrilled that the deck-building, rogue-like, story-rich genre is becoming mainstream. I hope that more games like this are made! A fantastic concept let down by everything being slightly off or clunky. the art style between gameplay and dialog dont match, the english translation moves too quickly, too slowly or pronounces things just differently enough to throw off my comprehension, the in-universe explanations and information vary from not-at-all to quite interesting lore at random, and the actual card battling is very solid but lacks a hook that differentiates it from every other card battling game.Its almost there in almost every way, and I want to love this game. Throughout the playthrough of Black Book, my feelings have been really mixed, it was a rollercoaster of various emotions and thoughts because Ive enjoyed some aspects of this game, but also this game has plenty that is annoying and quite bad.I feel like  Kyle  in his review described certain things that were bothersome to me as well, so there are at least two of us who find issues with the morality system, managing chorts, and the boss battles. The combat system is either super easy, especially in the latter stages of the game - which was wonderful, or it gets super annoying and you have to rebuild decks specifically for that one boss - which wasnt wonderful at all. However, what I did appreciate in this scenario was the fact I could just skip through the battles once the game realised my efforts are going nowhere might have been my difficulty setting perhaps, so that at least protected my sanity and it gave me the willingness to finish the game... which I definitely wanted to do and see how the story concludes, but I certainly wont replay, despite the fact, theres a lot to discover in terms of story, characters, playstyles, deck builds, different endings etc.Black Book also has plenty of moments that genuinely impressed me in terms of visuals. So much so, screenshots have been made and I could see many images as beautiful framed pictures on the wall, only for that feeling to be diminished by the poor  unappealing art style during the visual novel-esque parts of the game these sequences were also heavily crippled by voice acting that was all over the place, but I have to confess, Proshka the cat, sounds like John Mulaney and it was cracking me up the whole time. The characters in general were quite good, I really wanted to see where the story takes them, how will Vasilisas story end, what fate I as a player will concoct for her intentionally or not. But even here nothing is 100. Some story beats seemed kinda underwhelming, underdeveloped, certain plot points just seemingly ended abruptly when I expected there to be a battle for example, character moments many times came off rather strange as the morality system isnt that deep, some choices and actions seemingly didnt connect later for some reason... but I have to disclose that also could be my fault, as I was meddling with save files, to rollback to previous locations. Speaking of saves. The save system is quite bad, it felt counter-intuitive, oftentimes you are forced to take a single choice and live with it as going back to replay is not a convenient or viable option - which was the 1 cause for much of my frustration as Im a player who likes to experiment with different scenarios before committing to my default goody-two-shoes playstyle. Several times happened that a dialogue choice ended the whole thing and I was back in the izba with no way to go back, which again, suck for my way of playing, for getting achievements, or just simply going back to replay individual areas. Having in the main menu a menu of individual chapters, individual days even would be from my point of view so much better and much favourable option.The facet of the game I enjoyed the most was the mythology, the lore. Going through those stories, engaging with various characters based on myths  legends from this part of the world - Im a sucker for these kinds of things, so this was the most rewarding part of my playthrough. Definitely, something I would like to take a closer look at, and I hope the other work from Morteshka -  The Mooseman  will have something more from the Perm region.Overall, Im still torn, as I really want to like Black Book, I feel like it has the perfect combination of game stuff I personally like and gravitate towards, but to me, almost everything just misses the point, sometimes slightly, sometimes big time. Grade C The card game is fun but jesus, this game is unbearably long. The plot and folk events make no sense and I am ethnically russian. I am not even half way through and i logged in 20h. If they just cut off the filler, it would be a really nice dive into a lesser known culture rural Permian late 19th century tsarist russia but its frankly a slog. I initially enjoyed the game, but the difficulty quickly ramped up past a point where the game was fun for me. In particular, pretty early in the game you have to choose the order to do 3 quests - pick the wrong one the do first  you can end up in a pretty unwinnable fight.Tried turning the difficulty down, but the demon still got the same damage rather than half as the help claimed. Maybe I had to restart the game? Anyway, not for me but if you like more challenging games it might be more for you. This story based game is refreshing in the content it covers it was delightful to learn something about Russian folklore, even if only at a surface level. However it has a lot of major weaknesses that suck some of the joy out of its unique charm.This is not a good strategy game. Combat boils down to play the best cards, and wear the right immunity item. There are interesting interactions between some cards, but exploring them is unnecessary only once did I ever feel like building a deck around waste, and never bothered to touch mechanics involving curse, or self damage. All I ever needed to do was draw lots of cards, and then play them all, using the gesture mechanic.The puzzle sections are no exception. These are all damage optimization problems, and while some are challenging, none are interesting. What lessons they teach need never apply to the regular combat in the rest of the game. The over-world aspect of the game is severely lacking in polish. Just walking around and picking up herbs feels clunky, and incredibly unresponsive. You struggle to click the right spots on the ground. This is also how you control the camera angle, enhancing the frustration. To the developers credit, if you manage to get wedged behind something, collision with the object will turn off after around 15 seconds, so you can un-stick yourself. I suspect the fact that most of the game is spent staring at a 2d map, instead of the 3d locations, is that the developers understand the weakness of these sections, and wisely chose to break them up. However this doesnt fix the problem that theyre no fun.As a hard-core fan of deck building games, and as someone who enjoyed the story, I felt compelled to finish the game. While the choice of endings available to you are at least consistent with what is set up throughout the story, none of them are surprising, or especially satisfying.I write this long, ranting review, because I feel like there was real thought and effort put into crafting this, and I wish I could see more of it shine through. The style of the 3d set pieces seems like a great choice for an indie developer background areas are unique, and there are a lot of them, the low resolution assets allow the designers to paint in broad strokes, and it works pretty well. The writing, and voice acting, are very good, and are only ever bogged down by slow pacing, or the repetitive nature of some encounters. The mechanics involving resources, pages, and items are very interesting, its just that the game doesnt push you to explore them. Anyway, out some delusional sense of self importance, I would end this rant with a wish-list of things I wish had been different - Add a UI to the 3d areas that controls where you walk. No more clicking on the ground. Herbs and items are collected when you click on them, from any distance, using the actual bounding box of the herb. - Add sections to the game that reward you for pushing you deck as far as it can go. How many chorts can you defeat in three turns? How much damage can you deal in a turn? These sections could help push players to try out different archetypes. - Integrate the 2d map, and the 3d set-pieces into one screen. Too much time is spent staring at a black sketch of some woods and ponds, when you already have so many wonderful set-pieces! - Let me remove all the pages from the book when I want to start fresh, and implement the 13 page minimum by refusing to let me start a battle until said limitation is met. Clicking on something and failing to remove it is annoying. - Record a description of sins and good deeds in the black book, and let me see how they cancel each-other out. This could also be a flavorful and satisfying way to allow the sin counter to go above zero. - Real curses! The in game results of encounters are somewhat limited. Moneysinmiss out on exp If wrong answers could curse you, the same way that the chorts in your pester do, the different kinds of demons you encounter, and the consequences of angering them, would feel way more real. Ok thats all. Now that Im finished with this negative review, Im off to steal milk from a cow. This was a tough choice, but theres too many bad design decisions to make it worth it for me.The progression is very slow, and the game often unloads too much tutorial info at once. The conversations can be a bit repetitive and overlong. I kept wanting to get to the next mission or battle quicker.The exploration is fine, but its often unclear what a choice will mean when selected. Characters often ask questions to which you do not know the answer, resulting in unwanted sins or losing out on XP. Choices about approaching enemies have no way to determine what will work or what will put the player at a disadvantage. Card abilities are not explained clearly, and so on.The writing is a bit wordy, which wouldnt matter except every single line is voiced. The voice acting is fine, but I keep clicking through and interrupting the voiceovers trying to get to more gameplay.The card game is pretty simple. Its usually not hard to figure out the best play each turn depending on what the enemy will do next turn. Having that foreknowledge means that the card mechanics need to be much more interactive to maintain interest. I like some of the effects, though, its just not enough.If the game had been a little more card-battler and a little less visual novel and a bit faster overall, itd be an easy recommendation. The annoyances just overwhelm the good parts, which is a shame. Really wanted to enjoy this but I found the combat to be repetitive, and the puzzle battles to be especially tiresome. If you are hoping for Slay The Spire but in Russian mythology look elsewhere. This game is not that. This is a narrative first experience where you have seemingly very little input on the visual novel the game puts your through in order to get to the game play portions.The visual novel is kind of your run of the mill Slavic Dantes Inferno style affair or something. Instead of like actually deciding how good or bad of a person you are you just sort of listen to the voice actors read off their scripts.There is a vestigial management portion of the game where you have to send your demons out or else they get restless, but I dont really know why I want the demons to start with its not like they actually give me anything. It seems that all I get from them is Sin and cash money. The worst part is that you are sending them out to Curse people and no one ever yells at you for having a bunch of demons running around town terrorizing folks. I was genuinely trying to clear the map as often as possible and yet people were still acting like Im this kind wholesome loving medicine woman instead of a demon summoner sending demons to raid everyones pantries or what have you.The card battles are where the game gets good with interesting visuals and kinda fun mechanics that are very basic Slay the Spire style stuff. The thing is you spend so much time in between them listening to the Baba Yaga fan-fiction that it feels tedious to play. What I would personally love is a like Road to Hell mode that lets you play the card game with minimal story interjections. Maybe like a line or two between battles to explain what you might find ahead but thats it.As it stands I recommend this game if you enjoy Visual Novels with unique stories because Black Book definitely does that well. Vasya is this kind endearing character who has to make some choices that might be considered difficult and there does seem to be slight story deviations depending on how wicked you want to be.But like I said if you are looking for another Slay The Spire that focuses on Gameplay give it a miss. I feel like the trailer over-sold it a little. Its captivating, though. Kind of cute, and Ive really started to enjoy it, but I feel like its become difficult REALLY quick, and a bit unfair. When the fights get tough, theres not much you can do about it. Like itd be nice if I could have access to a merchant for herbs more often. And even though you have the ability to change the pages of your deck, they are still random, and much of the time if I need some protection zagovers, they arent there. If I need to do some heavy attacking, they arent there. Just luck of the draw.I also really wish I could name my saves. I dont think it was worth the price I paid, maybe less and it would have been worth it. All in all, Im having trouble playing because it is way too linear and its impossible to be resourceful. Its rare that I find myself in disagreement on an Overwhelmingly Positive indie darling.I havent experienced any of the crashes earlier negative reviews have mentioned the game has run flawlessly. The game is dripping with charm, truly unique and well researched atmosphere, and has some creative mechanics to boot running dual decks simultaneously, with Orders and Keys, is pretty clever. The fundamental problem thats just brutally beat down my enthusiasm for the game is that its just too slow.The loading times between steps on your route are too long. Conversations take too long. Combat takes way, way too long Ive cranked the text and animation speed up to the max, but to no avail. Encounters on your journey are all unique and handcrafted rather than procedurally generated, but so many of them none the less feel just like filler.Part of it may be that I opted for normal difficulty, as I generally do for playthroughs on new games, but have found it far too easy. That theres no tension or challenge to the combat encounters makes them feel all the more like a chore to get through. Id really wanted to like this title, but a chore really does describe what it feels like, and Ive been forcing myself to go through it for several hours now. The ending still seems remote, as there really is quite a lot of game here, but Im not sure its in me to finish it.If the Slavic folklore and atmosphere really resonates with you, I feel like this title could absolutely still be worthwhile, but purely on its basis as a game, I find this a pretty weak entry in the field of RPG card battlers. its just not fun to play, and the quality of life isnt very good. the card game has clunky physics that dont feel good. the game makes you read these long sections of stories in order to try to diagnose problems, and theyre just not interesting to read. sometimes you dont know what its asking you. its right on the cusp of being good but it isnt to me. the save system also resets you to the beginning of whatever location youre in, so up to about 30 minutes of gameplay that you can lose. maybe just something to get on deep sale. Soft deck building story driven game.The game is a mix of a visual novel and card deck building game. It also has some RPG elements - decisions that influence on future events and sub-RPG elements - gear and level advancement.- Visual novel part is represented by a story infused with an old russian folclore. It is well madeas for a visual novel genre and also has incredibly good voice actingoriginal language.- Card deck building part is also well made. Different cards are given to the player over the game course along with new enemies that encourage the player to use them. There also some puzzle card rounds where the deck is predefined for a special enemy set.- RPG part is surprisingly good for a visual novel. There are a lot of choices in game that will have a cut-off content as a consequence. Player also may chose between different ways of completing an encounter.Although the game is far from perfection. - It is still a visual novel. - It has stylish, but below medicore graphics, which sometimes is just out of placebut most of the time is ok.- It has a poor movement system and even worse - sometimes movement system is a part of a gameplay.- It has no resource balance.upd changed to Not recommended due to notification feed abuse. Devs will send you spam if you own the game and you can not avoid it in any way - so best option is not to buy.",
        "summary": "This game might be worth it on good sale, just be aware of the enjoyment-limiting annoyances built into the game. I was very torn about whether to give this a thumbs up or a thumbs down. I think it heavily depends on how patient you are about jank. If you really love to read about folklore, that could redeem the game for you."

        "text": "Breathedge isnt a great game. Its two pretty good games sharing one title.Game 1 is just what it looks like on first glance a free-roaming space survival game where you gather resources to build upgrades to increase how far you can safely travel. You can put plenty of hours into game 1 and have a grand old time, building up bases or puttering around on refurbished vacuum cleaners. Its pretty good. Game 2 kicks in kinda suddenly, though Breathedge does give you plenty of warning that youre about to pass a point of no return. In game 2, you leave behind any bases or vehicles youve built to engage in a largely linear story experience. Resources are abundant, but you dont really need them because theres no reason to actually build much of anything anymore. The gameplay takes a serious downgrade into full-on Walking Sim territory, but the writing takes a noticeable step up in quality now that it can just follow a linear ship. Its basically what youd get if you took Portal 2 and removed all the puzzles. Not great. Pretty good. This isnt an unfinished game. Its two unfinished games glommed together into one full-length experience. I give it a thumbs up because I had a good time, but the second half still left me rather disappointed at all the unrealized potential. Overall, it consider it worth the money and time I spent on it. Calibrate your expectations appropriately and you might enjoy it as well. I really enjoyed this game. Right up until I didnt. The first and second chapters are nice. A lot like Subnautica. You explore, survive, and craft, with a good mix of game mechanics. The humor is hit and miss - it made me laugh several times, and was never bad enough to get annoying, although it often walked that line. Everybody loves a good fart joke or a good breaking the fourth wall gag, but the game overdoes both. The environment is pretty. The story is... present... neither great or awful. It is just challenging enough to make it interesting, at least in the early game. Survival itself is never really a challenge apart from oxygen in the early game, so it is very much like Subnautica in that regard. As you get upgrades they really feel meaningful and you start to feel more freedom, and the game does really well for maybe 20 hours. The end of chapter 2 starts to get a little tedious, because you no longer have to worry much even about oxygen, and are just exploring and figuring out the objectives, but it isnt bad. I still had fun with it. The base building though...Unfortunately, despite the game giving you all kinds of options for base building, and being crammed full of little gag decoration items that you could put in a base, the actual implementation of the base is awful. The way objects despawn and respawn when you get far enough from the base interacts badly with the physics engine, so if you carefully place a bunch of furniture, containers, and decorations, it will look like it got hit with a tornado more or less every time you return to the base. There is a storage compartment you can build, but it is exactly the same size as a suitcase you can make much earlier in the game, and it cant be placed near the crafting table, so you invariably end up with a bunch of suitcases laying around to store things in. The base building part of this game is a massive disappointment and there is literally no reason to make anything more than the bare minimum you need with a pile of suitcases spread around on the floor, because anything you put time and effort into will just be destroyed by the game simply not working properly. And then you get to chapter 4. Ugh. Such a let down. It is abundantly clear that something drastic changed in the dev team at this point. The humor in the game takes a hard right turn into the sort of jokes that trolls use to try to trigger people in comments sections, and its pretty blatant. The sort of mildly and deliberately offensive things that attention seekers say online to try to get a rise out of people. Not at all funny, not even really offensive, just sort of sad and childish shock jock nonsense and culture war BS. Worse though because at this point I was already largely tuning out the humor is that the game becomes a walking down the hall simulator in the worst way. Go here, walk all the way back, craft thing, walk all the way back, use thing, maybe fight something. The entire time these empty, boring hallways are crammed with resources you no longer give a damn about. Youll never have to worry about oxygen again, let alone food and drink. The game goes from being something I genuinely enjoyed, to the most blatant lets make the game play longer arbitrarily nonsense Ive seen since my MMORPG days. In conclusion, if you loved Subnautica and can get this game on sale, it is probably worth it, but brace yourself for the massive disappointment that the game becomes for the last few hours. MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.  1010I bought this game on sale and let it sit in my library for awhile. I finally started it a few days ago and WHOA! Its a little brutal at first, and a bit repetitive going in and out of your ship for air, but once you figure out the mechanics and upgrading process, the game offers you quite a bit and is actually quite fun. NEWER INTEL PROCESSORS WILL CRASH 11th gen There is a workaround posted by a developer at the top of the community forum for people with newer Intel processors who are experiencing crashes. Some may argue that they shouldnt have to apply this workaround, and to an extent I agree, however, it would seem that as of this review they still havent patched it and applying the workaround is the only way to play it with newer Intel chips. HEY DEVS???? Patch your game. Too many people cant read or follow directions to apply the workaround. Youre getting negative reviews because of something you could fix in an otherwise great game!710 because of the workaround. 1010 if the DEVS step up and patch the game.EDIT  12212023Game is now 1010 because the DEVS stepped up and updated their game. I was going to delete that part of my review since it no longer applies, but perhaps people should see that they cared enough to patch their game.  WELL DONE! Breathedge can approximately be summed up with the followingChapter 1 EXCITING! A test of your skills, introduction to important things and the beginning of the lore!Chapter 2 A long, grindy affair, often requiring de-facto cow tools, did i mention everything is 5 km apart and you gotta travel in real time?Chapter 3 EXCITING, a new set of skills, humor! Lore! A new quest and gadgets!Chapter 4 Recreate the box art, several times, MORE LORE, a glorious trip and fun!Chapter 5 Excellent, a good ending, and more silly antics.So ill give it a 45 really.I can recommend the game, but do beware of Chapter 2, it is LONG and often requires you to travel back and forth alot unless you read a guide and came crazy prepared.Speaking of guides, read the one on how to get the space car, it will cut down travel time and save a very specific ressource, making chapter 2 more bearable. Unexpectedly enjoyable spoof.It seems unfair to tag this as similar to Subnautica, because it will get voted down due to unfulfilled expectations.If you dont compare Breathedge to other games and assess it in its own right, you may find that this game can provide hours of fun with exploration, building and much sarcasm. It does not take itself seriously, so if you are after a serious story you should look elsewhere. I found the lighthearted approach refreshing. To experienced gamers Funny Subnautica in space.To average gamers Survival game where you collect materialsnot very grindy to create tools that help you advance in a funny story.To noobs The comedy in this game will likely not be enough to offset the amount of stress you get from trying not to suffocate in space. You have limited oxygen that can be upgraded as you progress.If youre claustrophobic and hate planning small trips, Breathedge and Subnautica are not for you. Otherwise, these games are relaxing, entertaining, and super worth the money. For only having one chapter, and being in early access, this sure feels like a finished game. Honestly my only complaints are that tools have a durability when the resources used to make them are seemingly finite, which means careless resource management can result in an unsolvable situation, and that the speed of the voice acting, and things in general could do well to be slowed down a little bit. I felt a bit overwhelmed by how fast the suit was talking at me, so much so I couldnt appreciate some of the dialogue.I would absolutely recommend this game. Even in early access, having just been released, its already worth the price as is. Imagine if Subnautica was set in space and directed by Monty Python. This is that game. I really enjoyed the first chapter of this game, its truly shaping up to be a masterpiece.  I love the story so far, the crafting is on point, and the fact that it has this silly aspect really separates it from the other craftingsurvival games out there.  Great job on this beautiful game, I only wish I had more chapters to play! Ill be waiting! First let me say that the fact Steams recommendation algorithms never once recommended this game to me means they are completely and utterly uselessly broken. I one day had the urge to dig through the favorably-reviewed sci-fi games for any hidden gems I might have missed, and this diamond of a game was what came up after a couple hours of digging.Next let me say this Dont let the jokes on the store and news pages fool you. I was a bit hesitant, sometimes developers can get so absorbed in their could care less jokes like these that they end up treating their games the same way. The game itself is developed very seriously with lots of care, and lots of polish, not just for an early access game but for games in general. RedRuins the developer puts a lot of triple-A games to shame with the quality of their early access title.Now onto the actual game review itselfIts amazing. I love Subnautica, and as others are saying this game is like Subnautica. Except, everythings better balanced, better polished, better written, better exploration, etc. The black humor the game is suffused in does break the hard sci-fi of it, but at the same time they willingly explain why your suit cant even hold a minute of oxygen un-upgraded unlike Subnautica which just avoids the topic, why your flashlight has to recharge because its a piece of crap but at least you dont have to swap batteries out of it. and etc.The exploration is absolutely wonderful, and the suits AI just makes it even better. The black humor primarily comes in as you explore and see the various ways other passengers on the crashed liner died in their final moments because their suits only have 30 seconds of oxygen, of course. but you also have to handle various puzzles to get into some places, which is FAR better than just using a laser cutter to make your way in.Along the way, the afformentioned suit AI makes snarky, cynnical quips regularly. You come up to a person sitting in a chair thats been reduced to just bloody goop and bone, and the suit says He must have been shaving with a chainsaw when the crash happened for I can imagine no other circumstance that would leads to this amount of damage. Thats just one example, it would take me far too many words to properly convey how spot-on theyve made the dialogue lines, and the voice actor is absolutely perfect for him too.Onto the elephant in the room The black humor. Honestly its difficult to imagine letting yourself find humor in the portrayal of a massive catastrophe in space, with thousands of dead passengers and your suit AI being your only company. I found the humor as palatable as the humor in BBCs Top Gear show and Amazons Grand Tour, I guess. where a lot of humor is indeed drawn from its offensiveness. In other words, I really loved the humor in the game. Some of it is a bit much for me, but the little things dont detract from the whole here. I was going to leave such a raving review for this game..It was fantastic, gorgeous, atmospheric, and both relaxing and extremely stressful at the same time. In the first part of the game. Honestly just stop playing after chapter 3 and a bit of screwing around in chapter 4. The first part of the game is just so much fun. It rewards exploration so well and is filled with jokes, discovery and satisfaction. It promises base building and quality of life upgrades. You will enjoy it.Just make sure to enjoy it while it lasts. Because once you have the final upgrades... YOU DONT NEED THEM. WHAT?!The game completely changes into another game and shockingly becomes just a bunch of walk here through a stupid linear corridor for 5 minutes, then go back to your ship to craft something that you should have been able to craft on the spot.At some point towards the end you are not given an actual marker for what to do next and I have no idea how players are supposed to understand how to get the Microplasm on their own unless they accidentally run into it. I quit at this point.Of course there is the issue of tools being super flimsy but meh, thats not a deal-breaker.Ive never had a game turn from one of the best I played to one of the worst. I still highly recommend it because the first part is a must play on its own. Just give up and watch the ending on YouTube when youre tired of the bullcrap. Overall, I enjoyed this game. It was a fun and humorous story.It was more of a linear story, with some survival crafting elements. Youd go to an areas to get some resources, which would allow you to craft something, would would allow you to progress to the next area.The game did seems to be split up into different phases1st quarter - Surviving. Go out, get resources, and get back before you run out of air.2nd quarter - Base building, exploring, gearing up, vehicles, finishing tasks.Last Half - Leave all that behind  proceed through the story.Since this was my first time playing  I didnt know what to expect, I approached this like a survival.I spent a ton of time collecting hoards of resources  building my base.This all went to waste when I had to leave it behind.I even made the same mistake of hoarding resources for the last half of the game. I thought that Id need to recover what I left behind or that id need them when I got back. NOPE.Apparently, just craft what you need  dont worry about hoarding.I had dozens of suitcases filled with materials that I never needed.A super minimal base is fine. Though you could probably even get away without one.I do wish there was more to the base building. This is my first ever Steam review.   I felt compelled to make one since Im enjoying Breathedge so much.Subnautica in space is a very good description.  The mechanics are very similar -- exploration, crafting, base-building, a mystery, and the constant worry about having enough air to make it to the next destination.   Yet Breathedge is a game that has managed to carve out its own niche in the survival genre.  The focus on breathable air is  more pronounced because theres no handy surface of the ocean to kick for.  In this game, there is only the vacuum of space with small islands of salvation.  Humor sets Breathedge apart from other games of the same type.  Puzzles have quirky solutions that are not annoyingly obscure.   I never felt that the game made it impossible for me to logically find a solution.   Bonus  I enjoyed discovering the many inventive and hilarious ways that the passengers and crew of the Unnamed met their fate.All in all, Breathedge is a great game.  So far,  I have enjoyed it as much as Subnautica albeit in a different way.  Without constant creature threats at every turn, I was able to enjoy the visuals and the wit of the game.   I look forward to the full release.That said, Breathedge still has a lot of issues that I hope to see addressed before the full release-- Quick slots  four arent nearly enough, considering the number of tools there are in the game.-- Tools  they degrade too quickly.   Each tool should have an unbreakable recipe that needs to be discovered.  Combination tools should be available later in the game.  For example, I see no need to have separate scanners and analyzers.-- Equipment  equipment should be upgradeable.  In my game, space has been cluttered with my discarded junk.  Make it necessary to use that old equipment in the creation of the new.  After all, Im lost in space.  I nearly died to scavenge that stuff, I should be recycling wherever possible.--  Storage  Breathedge is begging for some type of coffin-tech.  There should be a coffin object which serves as shared storage that can be accessed anywhere.  Bags that dont actually hold anything seem like intentional trolling. Storage comparts appear to hold 4x more than than a suitcase.  However, they do not.  Why?  As a devout hoarder, I need more storage.  -- Communication the spacesuit AI speaks too quickly.  I wasted a lot of oxygen trying to read transcripts of the stuff that I missed. Messages from the suit often stacked on top of messages from Babe so that I wasnt able to comprehend either.  By the time that Babe finally stopped speaking, I found myself hoping that she had suffocated to death.--  Exploration  marker management needs to be simplified.  The game is beautiful, however, there is too much visual noise.  A simple toggle would have been nice.  If the game already has one, I missed it.  It would also be nice to toggle specific categories of markers as well -- oxygen locations, shuttles, and points of interest.  Once visited, locations should receive descriptive labels.  Better yet, allow me to label locations myself.  Finally, I hope that players will eventually be able to drop beacons anywhere that we like.--  Transportation  vehicle progression needs to be better.   I was disappointed by the second vehicle option.  It didnt seem much faster than the first.  I finally had a constant, portable source of oxygen.  However, travel was still tedious.  It didnt feel zippy or fun.-- Sustainable living  I founds seed and I have hope of growing my own crops in the future.  Please?   A reliable source of water would also be fantastic.For those of you who love base-building, the following may be of useIMO, habitat-building is the weakest point of the game.  I was looking forward to it.  Yet, now that Ive tried it, I dont look forward to ever doing it again.  The system is unnecessarily finicky and unsatisfying.There are two basic components to build a base, a module an empty room and a compartment things that can be placed in the modules such as beds, kitchens, and generators.  There are three different types of modules -- habitat, service, and transport.  They can be connected by corridors.   So far, so good.   Except, not really.  The modules are really hard to connect at any point other than the middle.  Hopefully, that gets fixed in the future.Except for their exterior color, all of the modules are identical.  Therefore, I dont understand why each one needs different comparts.   If I want to build a single-room base with power, O2,  a bed, and a processor in the middle, I cant.   Doors and windows arent interchangeable either which is extremely annoying and a waste of time.There isnt enough variety in building.  All comparts fit along the walls, thats it. The middle of rooms are generally saved for non-functional decor objects.IMO, the transport module should be the only specialized module.  As such, it should look different than the regular modules.   Hopefully, there will also be comparts that allow vehicles to be refueled and repaired while they are parked.  Body detailing comparts would also be welcome.There is a very useful add-on to the service module which keeps track of available oxygen and power, as well as hull integrity.  I love the look of it.   It would be nice if that compart also could be used to scan for essential components within the vicinity -- at additional power cost, of course.After building a habitat,  I didnt find it particularly useful.   The original shuttle at the beginning of the game as well as the Normandy serve the exact same purpose.  If the game allowed me to build my own functional shuttle, I wouldnt bother with habitat-building at all.Finally, I found the habitats to be visually bland and unappealing.   I guess that their clunky, utilitarian appearance is in keeping with the style of the game.  However, my base never felt like a home as it has in other games of a similar type.  It felt sterile and unwelcoming, but thats just me.  Despite the amazing volume of memorabilia and tchotchkes to be found in the game.  I didnt feel secure enough to set them out.  I was afraid that, after careful placement, I would return to find them all over the place.  Carefully stacked suitcases also seemed to have a mind of their own and went walkies whenever I left the base.Despite all of the above, the game is still worth more than a look.  It should be experienced. Subnautica without the constant anxiety if you have deep water phobia. Very chill game, simple crafting, exploring and humor. Fun story and silly. Reminds me of the old Space Quest games a bit in terms of humor. Mechanics and gameplay are easy. The game has a bit of an identity crysis and the jokes are hit and miss sometimes, but it has its charm, its a solid. Not great, not terrible.Some key pointsThe Subnautica like gameplay ends at chapter 3-4? They dont know eitherDont bother building too much of your base, its abandoned half way through.Afterwards it becomes a bit more linear and the survival aspects are mostly dropped, so its more like SOMA or something like that.Its very tedious at times, I think on purpose. You sometimes have to backtrack through long winding corridors that are winding for no other purpose than to pad out game time. Literally snaking corridors like this                                      -  -Story is a bit... not exactly generic, but full of cliches.Pop culture references are nice, I guess. Verdict 710Breathedge can be a fun game... if you are willing to suffer through it. As a veteran of games like Subnautica and The Long Dark, I enjoy slow-paced, relaxed games. However, Breathedge suffers from a couple of major issues that significantly tip the balance between work and fun toward the former1. Poorly balanced difficulty mechanics Sure, having but a few seconds of oxygen before you have to go back to the nearest breathing spot is an incentive to explore and gather resources to get better gear that will let you venture further. However, by the time you upgrade or get stuff that mitigates this, you already need to go even further... and back again. This back and forth gets old, and a poor balance means that the time you have ALWAYS feels too short by the time you manage to upgrade your gear. The equipment that ultimately lets you get rid of all this work arrives way too late, and my guess is that all but the most dedicated players will have abandoned the game by then.2. Cool stuff arrives so late in the game and has such steep material requirements that its not even worth using it MINOR SPOILER As an indie developer, youd expect they would have tried to maximize the fun while getting rid of assets and mechanics that will never be realistically used. Basebuilding is somewhat deep and complex, but unless you are dead set on engaging in it, you will find yourself building only the very basic you need to accomplish your goals, lest you suffer through hours and hours of back and forth gathering materials to install that one cute lamp. This is compounded by the fact that basebuilding arrives by the time your gameplay becomes highly nomadic... so whats the point of spending hours finding enough glass super rare to install nice windows on a place you will hardly spend time in before you need to move on?Storage space always feels extremely limited, so organizing your stuff is always HARD LABOR. Once you are finally ecstatic that you can build your first locker... you find that they have the same capacity as the pesky suitcases. Thats right... after a massive effort finding blueprints, building your base and collecting materials, a whole wall of lockers has the same capacity as a suitcase, which is 1100th the size. Why?If you can get past that, the story is fun, some gags will probably have you chuckling and the visuals are beautiful. And MASSIVE props for not only straying away from all the PC agenda, but actually making fun of its most hypocritical specimens. In this day and age, it takes guts for an indie studio to go that way. Update Free to claim and own on Epic Games from APR 27th - May 04th 2023Free to claim on Twitch with Amazon PrimePromotion ends at the end of January 2023. You can only activate and play it via Amazon Games app, not Steam. Extremely short, we know. We all know. Im going to give it a recommendation anyway because I would be super annoyed as a dev if all the reviews were turning negative for the sole reason that my early access game doesnt have all its content yet.Steam reviews are getting to be almost as stupid as Amazon reviews these days. Rating this game poorly for not being complete is the same level of dumb as rating a product negatively because you ordered the wrong size. If youre going to buy early access, dont give a bad review for receiving an early access product.You want frequent blog-like updates from the devs? Daily news? Great, thats more time taken away from actually developing the game. Just wait to rate, if you must, instead of dropping a negative review that says Ill change this later when updates happen, because doing that is harmful to the product. This game is an absolute palate-cleanser among contemporary survival-crafting games.When I first picked up Breathedge I had just finished Subnautica and was all emotionally invested in the genre. Breathedge rubbed me the wrong way. It was snarky and relentlessly self-deprecating and the recipes didnt make sense because dropping some rocks and unadulterated rare earth minerals into a magic molecule-rearranging box to get a laser cutter totally does. I didnt want funny, I wanted real desolate first-person grimdark immersive solitude. The Forest and Stranded Deep were too low-tech and I wasnt interested in the likes of Ark.Fast forward a year. I have played every survival-crafting game that even looks remotely worth it on the surface. I sink hundreds of hours into Satisfactory and Factorio. Food tastes like ash in my mouth. There is no joy in gaming any more.Now, in my darkest hour, I am ready for you, Breathedge.Pros The AI dialog is hysterical. There is a rich and diverse comedic subtext even in the placement of non-interactive props. The various ways in which your fellow engineers have perished is a prime showcase example of this. The things you actually do to get the game to tell you the story are as ridiculous as the story itself. Exploration and progression require putting yourself in danger. Graphics engine performance is tip-top at ultra detail on my dinosaur video card. Base-building is satisfying. Every junk item is worth picking up and spending a few moments reading the caption and inspecting it visually. There is a ton of attention to detail in the environment. There is not a plethora of information available about this game out there on the Internet. You can watch some YouTube videos, but if like me you resent modern society for forcing you to watch a video to get a piece of information instead of being able to quickly skim a text document somewhere ok boomer, you will have to experiment with the environment and reload saves and get real close to stuff and do that old school trial-and-error approach in order to un-stuck yourself. This adds an entirely new dimension of enjoyment in a time where games are often completely data-mined and dumped for the world to see before theyre even released, and you are expected to spoil yourself on how to progress before youre even required to have that knowledge. For some reason, I really like the sound that plays when you click a recipe in the constructor that you dont have enough materials to build. Its the ultimate NO YOU FAILED TO DO THAT sound. Though combat exists, it is sparse. The game is focused on survival, exploration, and story-telling.Cons Tool durability could stand to be tweaked over time. By the middle of chapter 23 I should not have to make a pile of drills to go Aluminum farming. Making tools all the time ends up becoming a bit of a chore, and occasionally results in having to revisit areas in order to acquire tech that you missed because there were more scannables than you had Scanner charges.  There are some things that are super obvious in retrospect but could use some extra context i.e. where discharge cells come from, others that are not obvious enough i.e. how one enables themselves to pull Breathedge energy cores or harvest Lycoplasma. I would really enjoy an option to turn off or modify the O2 alarm klaxon in some fashion. Even with the Military O2 Tanks and over 4 minutes of available O2 buffer I end up organizing my activities to ensure that Im back in an oxygen-rich environment before the alarm goes off. That thing is obnoxious.  Its not finished yet.Breathedge is the epitome of labor of love survival-crafter games and is a standard by which other games in the genre should be held. Thanks for an awesome journey RedRuins, I cant wait to see the rest of this amazing game! To start off, after playing Subnautica which was like main-lining heroin, i COULD NOT put that game down i went on a maniacal investigation for another game just like it. After trying out numerous games, some had scratched the itch of that survival craft concept, but nothing seemed to fill the void of ever finding a 36 hour, glued to the computer chair bender. Until one day i was desperately scrolling Reddit in search for another fix of endless material hoarding and fun crafting and came across a user mentioning Breathedge. After watching the trailer and reading reviews my spidey senses were exploding with excitement. I knew this had to be the one. 50 hours of gameplay later and here i am immediately writing this review seconds after finishing the game. The fact that i dont think ive ever written a review about a game in my life says alot. This game has so much personality that Subnautica was missing, and my cheeks are still sore from the constant full fledged belly laughter. With that said, i am now eagerly awaiting the release of Breathedge 2 and would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone in search of that Subnautica fix that i know everyone is dying to get a taste of!!!!!! I love this.This is gaming 101... humour, fun and visually pleasing.. just as good as subnautica, but less content yet of course, it took years for subnautica to be where it is nowYou should support this, in stead of a AAA games rehashed for the 253th time, with 15 paid DLCs and lootboxes.",
        "summary": "Breathedge is a free-roaming space survival game where you gather resources to build upgrades to increase how far you can safely travel. In game 2, you leave behind any bases or vehicles youve built to engage in a largely linear story experience. The humor is hit and miss - it made me laugh several times, and was never bad enough to get annoying, although it often walked that line."

        "text": "I dont normally write reviews, but felt compelled to do one for this game. A lot of recommendations compare this to Subnautica one of my favourites, and so picking it up seemed like a good idea...A few hours in, and I really cant stand the idea of continuing Breathedge.First of all, let me say this IS a well made game.Its got great visual style, and you can tell a lot of effort has gone into building it. As of writing this, the game is still in early access, and just a couple months away from its full release. I currently havent seen a single bug or performance issue.Its always refreshing to play a survival game especially one in early access, that isnt a janky mess with bland art direction.The game is clearly meant to be humorous. Unfortunately, its dialed up to 11 from the beginning, so its something youre either going to love or hate right away, theres no real in-between here. I wanted to like it, but ended up in the other camp...One of the things about the humour that annoyed me the most was actually related to gameplay. Which is the single biggest reason why I cant bring myself to keep playing this game.From the start, the game makes fun of survival tropes by having you do arbitrary things and laughing at how pointless it is. This isnt a one off joke, but something that happens over and over again, either in the guided objectives themselves, or just general gameplay. It ends up feeling like one of the most pointless and arbitrary games Ive ever played, and one of the most frustrating.Which brings me to why I now cant stand this game-GameplayLike most survival games, youll spend your time in the early game gathering resources and unlocking new gear as you go. Unlike most survival games, the tools you use to do this are a joke both literally and figuratively.So far, Ive found 6 different tools you will need to carry to collect different kinds of resources or complete objectives. And most are a variation of some junk duct taped to the end of a stick.Each one requires different resources to craft, and each one breaks after only a few uses this isnt an exaggeration, youll be lucky to use a tool more than 5 times before its dusted. When a tool breaks, its gone for good. You have to craft a new one from scratch each time.I might be biased here in that I generally hate item durability as a gameplay mechanic in most games. It never feels realistic or satisfying for a knife to completely break after using it to craft a few pointy sticks, or a solid metal wrench crumbling to dust after repairing a few metal plates.This game is by far the worst Ive played in this regard. Tools break after so few uses, it feels like you barely get more resources out of using them than they take to build in the first place. Be prepared to fill your inventory with duplicate tools each time you go out.In a move seemingly designed only to frustrate players, you have a grand total of only 4 slots to use equippable items 1-4 on the keyboard. When a tool breaks, you need to open the inventory and manually put a new one in the now empty slot. Oh, dont worry, the game doesnt pause when you access the inventory, so enjoy wasting oxygen while you faf around stuffing more junk into your pockets.This brings us to the next most annoying part of the gameplay-OxygenIts an interesting mechanic, and Im certainly not complaining about the concept being in a space survival game called Breathedge... Its just way too unforgiving in the first few hours of the game.Starting out you only have a single breaths worth of air to work with when you leave your ship. As you progress, you get upgrades to your oxygen capacity, and upgrades to an always too short-lived movement boost.Points of interest are specifically scattered around the area just far enough away to be reachable and returnable in one breath. You need to visit these places to get the blueprints or specific resources to upgrade gear and progress. Its just blind luck that you find something that will make your life easier sooner rather than later. Too bad if the larger oxygen tank or the movement boost was in the last place you looked, even worse if you managed to miss it completely.A lot of these locations have some interesting dioramas of the final moments of the Unnamed ships crew and passengers. Your spacesuits AI will also say some cheeky remark about what youre looking at.Its hard to really appreciate any of this, however. By the time you get to a place, you only have a few seconds of air to find whats worth grabbing and get back to the ship. The game actively punishes you for stopping to admire the environmental storytelling its built, or when listening to the suits banter. Strangely, the game does pause to let you read the wacky item descriptions of some of the things floating around these locations. So its not like the devs didnt understand the issue.Eventually you can slowly build little oxygen stations around the place to help get further away, but even those need to be re-supplied after a while. The early game is a lot of slowly floating to further away places, then slowly floating back, so you can then float a little further and back again each time.There seems to be a lot of friction in space around this crash site too I guess its sticky dark matter or something floating around right?. Your spacesuit will quickly slow down and stop when youre not actively pressing W, and will almost instantly slow back to normal speed after the short-lived boosts you can do.The boosts by the way, are caused by using gas from your own farts as propellant, and you can even unzip your fly and urinate all over things anytime you want, even in space! beware of the cold. These are the kinds of quality jokes that everyone will love, Im sure...I hear theres also base building and vehicles as you get further in the game. I might try and stomach going further to see if that makes things better. But I got to a point just after the game tricked me into building another literally useless item during chapter 2, and couldnt bring myself to keep going.If the game is making a satirical point about how stupid and tedious these annoying survival mechanics are, thanks Breathedge, I read you loud and clear! Honestly I really wanted to like this game, the trailer really hyped me and the reviews I saw were good. But the thing is, asside from the snappy companion AI banters, I found the game, well... quite boring. You spend most of your time travelling between points of interests, having only a few seconds of oxygen to spare to gather crafting materials, before you need to head back to your spaceship to avoid suffocating. Often times you miss a critical loot, and you get stuck in your progression because you didnt guess that breaking this particular box would give you that particuliar material that is found no where else in the game, which is required for reaching the next stage.. ... I spend a bit more than 4hrs in this game, and probably only played 15 minutes in those, the rest of the 3h45minutes spent moving around painfully slowly in empty space between places, with nothing to do beside looking at my oxygen reserve depleting.. I thought this would be like a space-themed subnautica which I loved, with a twist of dark-humour. What I found instead was a float around in empty space simulator with a twist of dark-humour..I would have loved to love this game.. but my experience was just empty, boring and frustrating.. I really wanted to like Breathedge, but its a pretty frustrating experience.  Its got all the interesting systems youd expect in a Subnautica-style survivalcrafting game.  The problem is that all those systems end up fighting each other rather than complementing each other.  For example The games graphics and world design are great.  But... the brutally-short oxygen gauge means you never have time to look at any of it. The game puts a lot of effort into its jokes.  But... theyre delivered so fast that you dont have a chance to actually listen to them. Youve got a variety of tools to build.  But... you have no way of knowing in advance what tool youll need at a particular location, so you have to carry them all.  And often, two of each, due to the low durability of each tool.  This takes up the inventory space you were hoping to use for stuff you collect when you get there. Theres a good variety of resources to collect and play with.  But... the early game has your resource storage split into several separate locations, leading to a lot of boring ferrying between stations.  A few hours in, you get a suitcase to store things in, which cannot be moved if it has items in it ?!. Tonally and aesthetically, the game is really strong.  But... it tries to be both a jokey survival farce and a dangerous-but-hauntingly-beautiful space simulator at the same time, and those two never gel together into a coherent whole.  The game is trying for a tone of whistling past the graveyard, but the whistle and the graveyard never seem to be in the same place at the same time.You can see the kind of game Breathedge wants to be something like Portal, a difficult game punctuated by black comedy.  It never really gets there. Just finished the game and watched the credit scene so heres my two cents.Breathedge is a game of two very distinct halves, the first half is the survival-crafting, exploratory phase, where you are flying through wreckage, salvaging usable components to crafting equipment, while wondering if you have enough oxygen left to return to base. This part is great and bears the most resemblance to Subnautica, which is the benchmark for how to make a fun survival crafting game. The second half is where things fall apart. You are now stuck to exploring  space stations on fetch quests, traversing through lonely corridors that seemly exist to pad out travelling time. Running back and forth to craft - in the developers own description - mandatory craps imposed by the design team. Theres one too many instances where you go to one part to get a blueprint for a device, then have to run back to your ship because thats where the crafting station is located, then have to return to where you got the blueprint to install the device just crafted. That is assuming you have all the necessary components on hand and dont need to spend more time scavenging. The games pacing comes to a grinding halt right there. What made the first half work is that the things you craft have impacts on the gameplay  an oxygen tank that allows you to stay out longer, a suit that gives you access to high radiation area, or a weapon to deal with enemies. By contrast the second half you are just crafting McGuffins, they look different and have different descriptions, but for all intents and purposes they are just keys you need to open the next door. If the first half of the game is about survival and exploration, the second half is nothing but busy work. That being said, the game is ultimately a parody of a survival-crafting game. I enjoyed the first half and some of the jokes are quite funny. Its worth a try if you can get this on a discount. As mentioned by others in effect this is a game of two halves.First half is a great space based exploration survival game although the only real danger is running out of oxygen which can seem very limited early game but after chapter two becomes almost inconsequential.I loved the feeling of the first half in general with it providing a great space based exploration based experience and i really enjoyed the humor although it did start to highlight some of the unfinished aspects of the game. You only really need to build one basic module for your space as station as it is required for the story to progress and while i did experiment with other modules they felt pointless and uninspiring and didnt even bother with the decorative items as certain resources either take a long time to find or seem very limited and for the most part dont seem to respawn.Using the regular comparison of Subnautica i would have great fun diddling around in my base making it look interesting or homely but there really is no point in this game.You can park your vehicle in the transport module yet you cant repair or refuel it while parked and if you changed the icon colour so it is easy to find it defaults back to the original after being parked.Theres a kitchen module which i couldnt seem to change the recipe with and seemed pointless as you can make the food with the construction bench.Theres a water dispenser which is actually a canned drinks dispenser and for decoration only.I didnt research most of the things on the research table as they werent needed.The oxygen stations are pointless after chapter one as there are fixed oxygen stations or places with oxygen at all points of interest.All of which didnt really detract from the generally great experience of just exploring in space in the first half but they did lead to a feeling of missed opportunity and disappointment.We then come to the second half. I note that i have played 30 hours in the game of which 28ish hours was in the first half and the remaining time was me trying to play the second half which i gave up on. Not for the commonly mentioned reasons that it is a generally different style of game, with it becoming more of a space based shooter with some more linear corridor based exploration, the fact that oxygen now becomes a complete non-issue or that everything you have done up to this point becomes effectively pointless but simply because of a basic control based issue which was game breaking for me.I was playing the game with a controller and i always use inverted y axis setting as that is natural for me. This was fine until you get to the second half where invert y axis doesnt work while flying the space shuttle but it does again when you leave the space shuttle although it was often buggy if i had tried to change the setting while flying the shuttle.i.e. if i chose invert y axis while in the shuttle it would often be none-inverted when i exited the shuttle and i would have to reselect inverted again for it to work properly. I managed to deal with it generally until i started encountering the drones which i needed to fight in the shuttle. The combat didnt seem particularly difficult but i simply could not control the shuttle so i could either re-learn muscle memory i have developed over the past 30 years of gaming or just give up and i gave up because it wasnt worth it and i have plenty of other games to play.It is a shame something as basic as this made the game unplayable but i feel that really sums up the whole game really. At its cores its a great game but it is a shame it wasnt polished which make you constantly feel disappointed at all the missed opportunities. I wanted to like this game but the experience it is not fun. You are barely given any oxygen to do anything at all and that severly impacts the exploration aspect of this game. Also the jokes the game is making start to annoy you when you have to constantly battle asfixiation. The gameplay cycle goes like this Need resources to build an oxygen station to recharge and travel further, then you need an oxygen generator to recharge the oxygen stations youve built. To explore further you need more oxygen stations, so what ends up happening is that you want to explore somewhere new but you cant because the devs were to strict with O2.To add insult to injury every so often you have to craft new tools because the one you have constantly break so then you either have two pairs of each tool as a back up taking a lot of inventory space or you will sometimes find yourself exploring but having to go back to recraft your tools. You know artificially prolonging the game, it even goes as far as to say it to your face literally during the game as a joke.In short It had potential but it was ruined by making it a chore to play. The game has a really nice start, it feels almost like Subnautica, but in space. Quirky humour all around - you know condoms as oxygen tanks etc. I dont mind the the humour, but the first time you exit your shuttle, music changes to very calming and serious, you see the space and it feels like its going to be a good game.There is a clear progression in the world, new objectives, something to keep you moving forward in your own pace. You gotta be thinking about oxygen, there is plenty food and water though. But the main focus is to find interesting places and find new things to craft. After some time you have opportunity to create your own base.But then, game suddenly takes a different approach and thats where things start to go downhillIn one of the chapters you leave that first area until the end of the game. Forget your base!Now we follow a series of very linear quests1. Fly with a VERY slow vehicle to point X YOU LITERALLY CANNOT EXIT THE VEHICLE AND FREE ROAM2. Enter point X3. Go in a series of linear tunnels till the end Additionally they are filled with water, food and materials4. Suddenly something blocks you and an item is needed, you get a new blueprint! Back to your vehicle by foot!5. Create the item and go back, clear the thing that blocked you and continue forward6. At the end youll unlock something, that gives you no benefits go back to your ship and onto the next pointThis literally is the game loop till the end.This was such a chore, especially given that the vehicle is extremely slow, there are no batteries in this game so you have to re-create items when they break imagine if they break at the end of points , and most of them have very low durability. Game just gets so boring and it was painful to finish it and this is the main reason I do not recommend it.I understand that some of this is by design, because this game is a parody, but it couldve been a really good game, even with this type of humour. It feels rushed towards the end and like they created a bad game just to say haha we parodied bad games, but its a joke bro!!!!11!!!!!!11.I sincerely hope someone will create similar game without all of this unnecessary humour and bad parts, because a proper Subnautica in space would be really awesome. EDIT I went back and played a few more hours after recharging my batteries, because it did seem like some new gameplay was opening up. Even with a vehicle and the ability to make new stations, my take remains the same. Tedious.A lot of other reviewers have done a good job of pointing out that, while it shares a lot of similarity with Subnautica, it is far, far more tedious. Low oxygen capacity means youre only able to focus on the task at hand and severely punishes any attempts at exploration, or even just lingering to take in the scenery. On top of that, there is a completely useless foodwater management system - both are abundant, so its just another series of button presses you are obliged to do every time you stop to refill oxygen. Health largely functions as reserve oxygen, as I have never been damaged by anything else, and initially it can only be restored by... resting in a bed. The game actually makes you sit around and watch your health meter go up as you rest.The speed of a travel and vast distances make for a lot of time spent in transit. Several locations can be reached quite quickly from the starter base, but as your oxygen reserve increases, you are forced to cross ever greater distances, taking longer and longer to get anywhere. As of 6 hours in, I am not faster than when I started the game, despite acquiring to accelerator upgrades - not sure what these are for if not to increase your acceleration and, I would hope, max speed. Another side effect of this is that, while some of the scenery is pretty nice, you quickly grow tired of it as you float slowly towards your destination.The narrative is undermined by largely played-out absurdist, 4th-wall-breaking, self-effacing humor, and this is coming from someone who loved Sunset Overdrive. The fact that they acknowledge using bad game mechanics in the narration like how the main character consumes absurd amounts of foodwater actually makes those mechanics MORE frustrating.It did seem like the game was improving somewhat with time - the ability to construct your own bases and use vehicles seem like they would improve gameplay quite a bit. Maybe if these had arrived less than seven hours in I would have stuck it out. This game has been BUTCHERED by the devs. Ive bought the game in early access and finished chapter 23 having a blast with its survival-like gameplay similar to subnautica. Then the release came. They literally killed the games orignal concepts and gameplay loops and change the pacing into some linear uninspired backtracking fest. No feeling of progression, no feeling of achievement, no struggle in space, no space building. Literally go to a structurebulidng, follow corridors, backtrack couple of times listening to some well-worn jokes rinse and repeat. I treated this game as a hidden gem and now its all but shattered.WHY? Why and when does this happened? First half of the game is very beautiful, good survival mechanics though the crafting process lacks a an enormous amount of polish and QOL.Second half of the game is the worst hallway  walking simulator Ive ever experienced, and it never gets any better. In fact, you have to back track tons of times. Literally 2 minute long hallways that you have to walk back and forth to progress.Youre probably going to have more fun if you just assume the game ends when you warp the Normandy to the next sector. Just pretend that it warped you home. Right, I normally do not write reviews, but wow, did this game disappoint when it was completed... The first 3 chapters were very, very good! Yes, a bit subnautica in space, and a bit frustrating at times, but if you managed your resources and time well, and continued to explore, it was very doable, and also rewarding. I do not agree with some comments about the oxygen time and tools durability, because the in game upgrades sort that out as you play bigger oxygen tanks, unbreakable handy scrapper. It was a very nice base buildingcraftexploration combo, with good humour and nice graphics...Now, for the 3 new chapters and the end of the game SPOILER ALERTBAD, BAD, BAD, from the beginning to the end, I dont even know where to start... loads of resources everywhere, but no more base building options... AT ALL... You get to fly the ship around Normandy, shoot some robots, walk along never ending base corridors, craft some small objects, warp your ship, and shoot some more... the story looses interest and focus fast, it is poor, gameplay is boring, and at times nausea inducing... I was waiting with a lot of hope for the last 3 chapters, where I would get to build another base somewhere else, with a nice shuttle airlock, to do space exploration in style aboard the Normandy... ZERO... the shuttle airlock serves no purpose, and no where in chapters 4 -6 can you actually get out to space in your space suit, and build a base... You can only exit the Normandy when you dock in an airlock, and there are only preset airlocks in the game, no freedom, no customization of gameplay experience, nothing...So very much disappointing... So much potential wasted... I think if this is the outcome of RedRuins Softworks getting a publisher HypeTrain Digital, they were better off taking their time, and going solo...Utter rubbish, stay away from this game!PS The storage locker module is a joke, 3 doors, 1 storage cabinet only, and there is an annoying bug where you cannot scan a glass panel with dead hamsters that unlocks a display module for those who like to collect and display, it is very annoying, particularly because this has been flagged several times during the early access version, and wasnt fixed for the release version... sloppy. Game stops being fun long before you reach the end. While the crafting and exploring is great at first, once you start exploring the main station it just becomes fetch quests that make you traverse long stretches of empty hallways. The game even jokes about it at one point, offering you the option to fast travel to skip these long boring walks, then laughs and denies you it forcing you to continue walking. Dear games devs, pointing out a flaw in your own game and then refusing to address it doesnt make you clever. It makes you an ass. This game has been on my radar for a while because I love a good base-builder and Id seen it favorably compared to Subnautica, a franchise Ive been fond of for years, and I heard it took an irreverent, fun approach to sci-fi. I hoped to have at least a few hours of fun. I did not. First, let me get the thing many of the other reviews talk about out of the way the writing. Its awful. This has nothing to do with whether I think the jokes are offensive or not, or whether Im mad theres jokes in the first place its just kind of terrible on a technical level. Every single opportunity available is taken to harp on about how silly and stupid it is that Other Video Games do things like give the player character specialized skills suited to their situation or seemingly meaningless goals to work towards. The AI companion talks way too much and too often, has a grating voice, and it gives me no information and no jokes worth laughing at. The humor is the main problem, but its not the only one the few pieces of writing in the game that arent meant to land as jokes fall incredibly flat. There is no depth and no intrigue and no layers to anything. Now, Ive seen many supporters of the game say that if I dont like the AI companion, and if I dont like the writing, I should simply turn down the voice volume and ignore the flavor text. Its true, I could do that, even though all the Funny Joaks do make themselves very intrusive. I could do this, and it would help, if the game was good. Its not. Its really bad. You can see by my playtime that I gave it a solid shake, but I realized pretty fast that any positive comparisons were Subnautica were code for everything remotely promising about this game is directly lifted from Subnautica. The basic loop of go outcollect resourcesreturn before oxygen runs outcraft items in pod, while unoriginal, is the basis for a good game, but the devs have done nothing to improve on it and have stripped it of most of the things that actually make Subnautica good. The UI -- especially the crafting interface -- is confusing and frustrating to use. So is the hotbar. So is the item placement system. The HUD is intrusive and ugly. The carefully-crafted balance of the timing in how long it takes for oxygen to run out vs. how far away things are that makes Subnautica so addicting from early game to late game is thrown out the window in Breathedge -- its just frustrating with no payoff. I could go on, but Im honestly tired of talking about this garbage game, so Ill try and sum it up.The way the developers of Breathedge approached both the story and the design of their game shows that they intrinsically do not understand what in either of those categories makes a video game actually enjoyable. A game with very limited and repetitive gameplay but good, interesting storytelling can be a transformative experience. The same goes for a game with little to no writing but well thought-out, engaging gameplay. Some games have both, and thats also great. Breathedge has neither, and Redruins seems to think that thats really cool, so I honestly do not think anyone should give them their money for anything. Feel free to disregard everything Ive written here and call me a triggered lib, though. Sadly, I cant recommend this game. I wanted to enjoy it really bad, but I simply couldnt.You will read a lot in other reviews that this game is Subnautica in Space, but this is exactly the problem with this game It tried too hard to be Subnautica, and it failed miserably in every aspect of it.Some mistakes are just too grotesque, like the sheer quantity of useless items that you will learn to create and will serve to almost nothing, for example, there is literally one item that you create to open one single door the entire game, but as you never know when the game will ask again for that item, you end up carrying that thing around just in case. The oxygen system is a mess as well - Its too freaking hard in the beginning, and just a nuisance later, and its something that is basically forgotten halfway through the game.The game lacks focus, it lacks commitment, and you are left with a mess of a game that is full of awesome concepts, but never deliver it right.And again, this is really sad. You can see that they COULD HAVE been Subnautica in Space, but its just a project of some guys making fun of everything, all the time, without thinking exactly where this is leading. I wont even comment the story of the game... Or the writing. I feel dumber after playing this.Apart from that, the art and design team should receive a prize, its the true highlight of this game. I loved the graphics, the soundtracks were right on point, and you can see that they goddamn knew how to model all those props. Everything looks good, even sometimes when people are dead - They are a frozen art of gore. But they decided to be too gore for their own sake as well. Anyway this doesnt take away their merit, they were awesome. But then again, its kinda sad that the level design didnt exactly match the survival aspect, there is not so many places where you go ohhh, this is a perfect place for me to build a base!, but then again, this game is not a good survival game.To sum up, I think that, if the art team had a better director and a better writer, this game would be worth it. But the game looks like a conglomerate of ideas rotting due of lack of decisions and commitment. And this sucks. So tedious and boring. Clunky  slow UI. Just interesting enough to get you past the 2 hour refund window. Then youre stuck floating back to base for 15 minutes to make another harvesting tool for the 5,000,000th time. Lets start simple, whatever you might think Breathedge is, it isnt.  I had to read a few of the positive reviews before writing this and Im definitely going to be criticizing the game for seemingly all the things other people liked about it.  Its odd, there are positive reviews explaining that the game is tedious, poorly structured, and superfluous but its funny.  I agree.  I found it to be tedious, poorly structured, and superfluous thats precisely the reason I didnt like it.  Its not even hard to articulate why everything in the game is an excuse to get to  irreverent non sequitur commentary delivered by your spacesuit.Its like, I get it.  The joke is that its a bad game.  The developers are self-depreciating, the game frequently quips at how meaningless or stupid many of its decisions are and Im nodding my head.  At one point the suit AI literally goes, Does this game even have any mechanics?  No, it doesnt.  Thats the joke.  Ha ha.  Would be nice however, if it did.  The game this most reminded me of was that Devolverland promotional game made for E3 a few years back with crafting mechanics bolted on.  Its not that Breathedge is bad.  Its not incompetent enough to be bad.  At the same time though, it has a careless feeling rather than a carefree one.For example, theres this running chicken gag.  I mean, the game certainly says there is but it seems to have forgotten to have it be a running gag.  The chicken is used once at the beginning and then to short out electric currents sometimes and then at the very end.  If the chicken had been a prominent character, been involved in more cutscenes, maybe was responsible for some of the many failures you experience then it could make sense.  But nope.  The game just says it has a running chicken gag and I guess thats the part where I fall over laughing until I cry.  It definitely feels like no one cared or even noticed.Lest you think this is a quality only of the writing, no.  For example, the thirst and hunger mechanics.  You find food and water everywhere you go and it takes forever to run out so why is it here?  Because survival games have these mechanics hur hur hur?  Im not even sure thats it.  Early on you can craft a better helmet.  Spoiler alert you just paint the helmet entirely red and cant see anything when wearing it.  Its funny, but heres the truth of the game radiation is also a non-issue.  You just have to complete the quests, the actual rating doesnt do anything.  Again, hur hur so subversive.  The game is seemingly making fun of itself, and yet its still just just about achieving the goal of being precisely what its mocking.  In my opinion, it fails to meet its own low standards thanks to aspiring to nothing more than minimal competency.So no, I cant recommend Breathedge.  I can praise it for its technical feats, but being basically playable and looking nice is the bar games are expected to clear.  As far as unique selling points it has a nice pulpy sci-fi aesthetic and I can at least admit a few lines made me chuckle, but as a complete package I guess the joke is that anyone like me would actually play it to the end and be disappointed.  Its hard to critique something that is knowingly bad, Breathedge is basically just Sharknado in game form it aspired to be mediocre in pursuit of a premise but Im not going to give it a thumbs up just because it knows its dumb. Way too plodding.  The environment is not interesting enough in the long run, the crafting is tedious in spite of the low complexity, the survival elements are meaningless except for oxygen, and the basebuilding is an afterthought.  Oxygen is your main progression gate to getting around, which would have been fine if the game was more interesting, but instead it feels frustrating.  The dialogue is persistent and tries to be humorous, but is mostly pretty bland some of the visual humour is a bit more amusing, though hardly a draw.  For positives, I liked how they designed visual cues to facilitate exploration in a directed way, and its a visually interesting space setting for a little while, anyway.  Couldnt bring myself to finish it - I think I made it about halfway to two-thirds into the game.A meta joke about how developers pad their games feels like twisting the knife rather than a funny gag when your game is boring. Pressing W for 5 minutes for a sarcastic joke.orSubnautica, but dead and slower.Alternative, terrible, but more accurate titles for this game.Breathedge is both amazing and disappointing at the same time.Which is the reason my review is so long... I honestly think these devs are cool, just read the steam page and some of their updates. Sadly that doesnt change my gameplay experience.Almost everything in there is good quality- awesome graphics, very nice aesthetics... everything just looks great with realistic and ridiculous designs mixed together perfectly,- awesome soundtrack,- the humour is nice, but can be too much for some, I personally like it,- progression and equipment you get are nice although the pacing of them is NOT.There are also problems, but theyre not as apparent at first as its awesome graphics or cool soundtrack.In a nutshell your time outside is painfully limited, and most of it youll spend by just pressing W.Also space is dead.While some of these problems might seem minor, or even ridiculous complaints, Id like you to keep in mind that the devs are aware and even make fun of ridiculous game designs and mechanics.They added an objective which specifically makes fun of missionsmechanics that are only in a game to artificially extend gameplay without adding actual content, and yet for the majority of Breathedge youre just flying through empty space.At the beginning you get 50 seconds outside, but most of the important things are 15-20 seconds away. So youll spend 30-40 seconds flying, and 10 seconds actually doing something. This ratio will only get worse, because you get bigger O2 tanks, but things will also be farther away. Youll be flying for 1-2 minutes and do stuff for 10-20 seconds at best.theres no radio to listen to in your space suit, and you cant even set a course and a get a glass of water because theres space friction, you cant even open your inventoryAnother big problem is that some of the progress you make is nullifiedwaste of time, because at some point in the game you can research items that you would find outside at debris. So first you spend time to grind the resources for the research, then you finally make yourself go out and fly through space for 2 mind-numbing minutes just to realise the debris youre at has the item you already researched. Not only a waste of time, but makes you think that you mightve bypassed certain elements of the game, basically took the easier way to progress.This limited oxygen really discourages progression for a new player, since you have to use consumable items to complete objectives, but you also have limited resources, and absolutely no idea whats gonna happen when you actually progress.Taking risks either with your life after which you need to load or by exhausting your resources might need to to restart the whole game would be less of an issue if you didnt need to do the exact same things 5 million times throughout the game... if it needed some skill. But this combination of mindless repetition and being forced to risk your run is very bad.Basically devs shooting themselves in the foot with the limited oxygen mechanicYou cant enjoy the beautiful environment, soundtrack and the witty commentary of the AI they created, theres just not enough time at the beginning. I mean your oxygen is running out so you just have to scan, collect and progress as fast as you can, often cutting voicelines, because the alternative would be to fly another minute back and forth. When you finally do get enough oxygen the novelty is already gone.O2 recharge is unnecessarily slow, especially at manual recharge stations, where you have to press left-click for seemingly hours for a full tank. Why? It serves no purpose.Its easy to miss some of the upgrades, which really amplifies the problems I described above.Compared to Subnautica- While the distances and travel times are similar in both games, the in Breathedge you have small bubbles of O2, instead of having the whole surface of an ocean, which severely slows down progress.- No wildlife to look at, no enemies to be afraid of. With all the ridiculous but funny ideas they put in the game, spacemonkeys and spacesharks in there wouldnt really stand out.- Crafting is clunky in Breathedge you cant open your inventory while moving, you cant walk away from the Processor while crafting items, you cant build multiple processors to craft faster.- For hours theres nothing that would ease your gameplay in Breathedge. As you get better items, youll need to go father, always stretching your O2 supply. In Subnautica the Seaglide or even a basic O2 tank felt like a gamechanger and you also get a Seamoth in just a few hours in. In Braethedge theres no cool upgrades, you just get the bare minimum.What could help1. For starters they could increase the actual speeds to what the UI shows. Your spacesuit is supposedly capable of 12 ms, while the actual speed is closer to 6 ms.2. Communicate more clearly which resources are renewable. That would make certain consumables more appealing.3. Dont let us waste time on research if we gonna find the blueprint 3 minutes later. Dont make the need to explore and the need to research mutually exclusive.4. Dont draw O2 while the AI is talking. Yes, its stupid and its unrealistic, but unless we get more time outside, I just dont have time to pay attention to that guy. You designed the game in a way that I have to hurry.5. Let us do something while flying through space. Add a spacesuit radio, or let us open inventory, or remove space friction from the players base movement only for the 12ms speed, the accelerator effect should still wear off... anything, really.Either one of these would be a great addition, although the 1st change by itself would solve most other issues. At first I found that it was not playable for me because of my Intel 11th Gen CPU. No, this is not the fault of Intel or Windows, it is the fault of the developers. The developers have known about the problem for several years and have done nothing. But okay, there is a temporary hotfix to work around this bug. This made it possible for me to start the game.But now I cant play the game at all, because every few minutes the game crashes with a LowLevelFatalError. There is no way to fix this error or continue playing the game. All the things I tried did not lead to any success. The developer is no longer active. I can only warn against buying the game. Youd think this game would be non-stop chuckles from the trailer. It really isnt. There are a handful of moments that can get a good laugh, but most of the time, the jokes are just...landing with a wet thud. The AI talks too much, the dialogue is trying too hard, and having tools break so damn quickly is annoying. It apes Subnautica literally at one point but doesnt understand that you need nuance and subtlety to make anything of that kind of game. The second half basically abandons the first half and shoves you into more and more constricted corridors of gameplay, more or less giving up on everything youve learned up to that point and when the big reveals to the story, such as it is, appear...Well, lets just say I felt very very condescended to. Like I was an idiot and the punchline was that the developers were laughing at me for it. Sure, other games do that too...but they at least recognize that, as a player, you should probably have SOME kind of hint to it. Here, the twist is dropped and you find out things that you, the player, could not possibly have known. Its annoying. Like I said, this game desperately wants to be SUBNAUTICA BUT IN SPACE WITH FUNNY. It just...isnt funny for long. It isnt Subnautica. It isnt good. Get it cheap if you really insist on punching yourself, but do not pay full price. Oh, and one other thing when more than half of the achievements are blatant meme ripoffs...thats usually a tip that the devs did not take you seriously as a player. Avoid unless on VERY reduced sale. No replay value, not a lot of fun, not as funny as it thinks it is, generally irritating due to how much promise it could have delivered on and, due to laziness, just did not.",
        "summary": "The game is clearly meant to be humorous. Unfortunately, its dialed up to 11 from the beginning, so its something youre either going to love or hate right away. It ends up feeling like one of the most pointless and arbitrary games Ive ever played. When a tool breaks, you have to craft a new one from scratch each time."

        "text": "You are a smart person. You read reviews for games before you buy them, just to make sure you know what youre spending your money on.What you need to know about Outer Wilds that it is the worst game to get spoiled on, possibly ever. Anything and everything you learn before playing has the potential to harm your experience with it, and even the storys premise and basic gameplay mechanics are things that you do not want to get spoiled to.Yes, this makes Outer Wilds a difficult game to sell, but, trust me, its a good one. There are negative reviews out there, sure, but a surprising amount of people say that this game is the best theyve ever played, unironically. I cant explain why youll like it, but there is a pretty good chance that you will. If you dont, you will most likely figure that out before the refund deadline.So, stop reading into it, and play this game. The risk of getting spoiled by other reviews is too high. If you arent sold on it yet, then go ahead and keep reading  with caution. Everyone says that Outer Wilds is best experienced when you know nothing about it before jumping in. And theyre right. But still, this makes it difficult for an outsider to decide whether or not they want to buy the game yes you should so Im going to try and describe the kind of game it is and what the experience is like, without spoiling anything.This game is a spatial exploration game in a fictional solar system, mostly based on uncovering the knowledge and actions of an ancient civilization. The game is entirely based on discovery and information gathering your ship log records what you learn, and thats your progression. There is no other character progression than the knowledge you accumulate.Early on in the game, youll find that something is going very wrong. Theres a mystery that you will want to solve, and the only way youll solve it is by going out in the universe, gathering clues and piecing them together. You decide where to go and what to do based on your own curiosity and desire to learn when you explore a place, you learn things that give you background knowledge andor hints about how to get past obstacles in other places. If you find yourself blocked, go explore another planet chances are the information on how to overcome whats blocking you is written somewhere else. The game is totally non-linear and encourages you to try new things.At first, you get scattered bits and pieces of information and you dont understand anything, its totally baffling. Then, as you get more bits, you start seeing connections and elaborating theories on what the hell is happening. This is a very exciting and enthralling part of the game, the reason why spoilers are so bad for this game, and the reason why you shouldnt use Internet guides. Making hypotheses and figuring out where you need to go next in order to check these hypotheses is a huge part of the fun and the experience, and you shouldnt spoil yourself out of it.Then you get key elements of information, and the pieces of the puzzle start falling into place. In the end, when youve almost explored everything, you finally understand whats going on, and its incredible. Everything is cohesive, all the things that you couldnt figure out at start make perfect sense, and youre awestruck by the immaculate story put together by the developers, and by the grandeur and beauty of it all. And in the same moment, you know exactly what you need to do to finish the game.During the whole experience, you meet a lot of characters. Your fellow Hearthian explorers, who each have their own personality, but also Nomai characters whose lives you read about on the walls they left behind, and you grow attached to them. The game isnt only a pleasure for the deductive center of the brain its full of emotion, too, and the end of the game  is powerful enough to make the most cold-hearted of us melt into a puddle of tears.This game is unique, its exciting, its nerve-wracking at times, its fun, its tragic, its heart string-pulling, its awe-inspiring, and my only regret is that it can only be fully experienced once. Once you have played it, it will be your regret too. Outer Wilds is like opening a book to a random page and starting to read.You get the gist of it but ultimately understand nothing. No context. No direction. No familiarity with the characters or the world. The information you gained by itself is essentially useless, so you move on.You jump to another random page. Youre given another piece to the puzzle, but youd be insane if you expect it to fit together with what you learned before. No connections can be drawn, no epiphanies can be made. You have so little to work with, so, again, what you learn is useless.At this point you have one of two choices.You either concede to the absurd nonlinearity of the experience and forfeit any opportunity to discover what lies just beyond the horizon...Or you keep turning those pages.If you keep reading, youll find yourself with piece after piece, all of which seem to have nothing to do with any of the others. You turn those pieces around in your head, spinning them and jamming them together and hoping that you found a clue, an answer, anything that makes sense.You will fail. Gloriously, in some cases. Horribly, perhaps hauntingly, in others. But the more you read, the more pieces you have. And slowly, very slowly, a picture will inevitably form. You have what it takes to see it in its entirety, but you have to earn it. Step by step. One page at a time. Its not easy to write a review for this game since the best experience you get is if you know as little as possible about it.That doesnt make it easy to decide to buy the game though, so Ill try and outline what the game is and what it isnt.This game is a first person exploration puzzle game set in space.There is no voice acting, no quests or objectives with markers on the map.Theres no combat and no upgrades or unlockables.It will not tell you where to go or what to do, it leaves everything up to your own curiosity.The only thing you gain in this game over time is knowledge. You can complete this game within 20 minutes as soon as you start it the very first time if you know what to do. But you wont for hours - youll find clues as to what is happening and where to find answers for specific puzzles or obstacles along the way to point you in the right direction.Everything you learn will be recorded in your ships log as a visual representation of not only visited locations and facts you learned there, but also how they connect to other things you know about or have read or seen so you dont lose track of things.Most of the clues throught the game are text you read - never a lot at a time, but small snippets of text strewn acrossan area you are exploring.The puzzles arent just puzzles for the sake of being puzzles. Pretty much every puzzle is the environment itelf. A cave that fills up and is inaccessible at certain points, entrances that open when specific things happen and so on.You never feel like youre solving a puzzle - you always feel like youre exploring and learning new facts about the worldyou are in. There thought of what am I doing wrong quickly changes to what do I not know yet if you get stuck on something.Every system, every clue and everything you learn will come together towards the end of your journey in a nice and organic way.If you like exploring things for the sake of exploration, to get to know what is happening in the world around you or if you like space exploration in general this game might be for you. For 24.99 you can play a piece of art that will break your heart.I adore watching others play Outer Wilds, just to recapture a piece of what it felt like to point my ductaped little deathtrap of a spaceship into the dark places that I feared more than I understood and to do what Feldspar would do floor it.I sat in front of my computer and cried at the end. Six months later Im still crushed that I can never play it again.Theres no better use for your computer than playing this game. the only bad thing about this game is you only get to play it for the first time onceedit also the fish i hate them Outer Wilds is a generational game. It may even be a once in a lifetime kind of game. And although this may not be the case for everyone, from the accounts of some of my friends, it always seems to be a game you play right at the time in your life when you need it. This review is going to be a little personal, but I played Outer Wilds while my mom was dying from covid-19, and I beat it the night before she passed away, and I can never thank the developers for making a game which touched my heart so strongly.Outer Wilds starts out almost humble in a way. You cant do anything but walk around and jump and talk to others. Yet it quickly snowballs into something quite magical. From launching your rocket to space for the first time, the story becomes not one of achieving space travel, but to saving the universe by uncovering its greatest mystery. And although its incredibly daunting and you dont even know where to begin, somehow things just happen to fall into place, almost like magic.Outer Wilds story is a little hard to grasp when you focus on the details, and it plays into some abstractness for story-telling purposes, but it works perfectly for me. Its a story filled with moments of immense joy, and sadness, and ultimately one of the best conclusions, if not the best, to any video game Ive ever played. The lessons at the end of the game are presented so simply, so directly, but with such charm that I cant imagine any other way of doing it. Outer Wilds is simply beautiful from a story point of view.I really wish I could say more, but Outer Wilds, maybe more than any game Ive ever played, demands to be played as blind as possible.Outer Wilds gameplay consists of relatively simple platforming and exploration, carefully maneuvering through the world to find every last clue and piece of evidence to help put together the story. The way the game uses knowledge as its skill-check, instead of physical skill is incredible, and its been many, many years since Ive seen puzzles integrated so well into gameplay. I may have never seen it integrated this well before, nor may I ever again. And the way the time causes nearly every aspect of the game to change is just brilliant. You dont need a galaxy brain to beat Outer Wilds, but you cant put it all together if you dont start to fire the neurons a little bit either. Its just all perfect. Every clue is so masterfully crafted, every location so expertly designed, every hint so perfectly placed its flooring, in a way. The art style is so brilliant, the music so incredible, the sounds so captivating, that its honestly astonishing that anybody couldnt give this game a 910 or better. Its beauty is generational, and it reinforces some of lifes most important lessonslearn from your pastcarry what you must to your futureleave what you can behindtake advantage of the time you have with those you loveand most importantly from sad endings come new beautiful beginnings.1010 OverviewOuter Wilds is an exploration based game created by Mobius Digital. In this game, the player controls an unnamed astronaut trapped inside a 22 minutes time loop. When the last grain of sand falls, the sun will explode and you wake up again, in your campfire side bed, to start all over again. Outer wilds is a meditative experience about death and the universe, about exploration, discovery, history. It is also a technical wonder of a videogame. Its a simple concept wrapped with a tremendous amount of love and precision that I simply think this game is a masterpiece. The GoodUnbound freedom of space voyage inside a carefully built and simulated solar system. The game evokes such a tremendous feeling of discovery in most parts of the game.Spaceship and Zero G controls that feels authentic, but doesnt get bogged down by obsession with realism that it becomes cumbersome. Great story told masterfully. The game never tells you any objectives at all, but the exposition is created no matter which planet you start with, the trails of plot and mystery can be followed naturally.The BadBrittle Hollow can be annoying to traverseAuto-pilot can be dumb and launch straight into the sun sometimesGameplayThe whole game is a race against time from discovering a clue about a location and actually discovering them. Your time will be spent mostly on flying, walking and figuring out a way to some point. Spaceship control is tight, without being too arcadey nor obsessed with realism that made it a clunky death trap. Auto-pilot is decent as long the sun isnt directly between you and your destination. Zero-G control also feels good and very authentic. Gravity changes depend on the size of objects, your distance from it and experimenting with how physics works is always fun. There are quite some wonderful navigation puzzles like delving into underground labyrinths that are slowly being filled with sand, or figuring a way into a frozen comet. The exploration is almost player motivated. While it has a goal, the game doesnt tell you about it at all, but the players own curiosity will propel them to the end.The most unique aspect of Outer Wilds is that physics is simulated. Gravitational pull of the planets, their orbits, even events that are happening during the 22 minutes loop. Using this, the astronaut is forced to take everything into consideration. The planets arent stationery, so even using autopilot, to land, the planet still moves below you so you must adjust your velocity. Times flow, the celestials body relative location to the sun, etc can be a crucial part in solving puzzles.You are also given several tools to help with your adventure. The first and your best friend is the scout. Its a wireless camera that you can shoot and will stick on the surface of things. The scout can take monochrome photos and this will help you survey a distant landmark whether its safe or not. It also can detect deadly ghost particles that will kill any living being that enters its vicinity. On top of that function, it can also be used as a lightsource. The second one is Nomai translator, an extinct race central to the background of the solar systems history and the mystery of the exploding sun. their writings are your main source of information and plot exposition. The last one is the radio receiver that lets you listen to radio signals from quite a distance. Bugs and Technical IssuesSpecs GTX 1080, Ryzen 3700x, 16GB RAM, 1440p 60HzThe game is well-polished for me. I didnt encounter any bugs or crashes freezes. With my decent rig, it ran at 60 FPS with some drops to 50s in some more intense locations. Beware that this game has pretty demanding CPU requirements due to the simulation it is doing at a time.StoryYou are an unnamed rookie astronaut, the latest recruit from The Outer Wilds Ventures. All your seniors have spread their wings and visit other planets. The hearthian species hope lies upon you, as you are the first recruit to be armed with Nomai translator. Hearthians have studied this enigmatic race. Who are they? Where did they come from? What is the secret of their advanced technology? How did they die? With endless curiosity and presumably years of training, youre ready to take off to solve this mystery once and for all. Just before the launch, a Nomai artifact activated on you that send your memories back in time for 22 minutes. As you travel the solar system, you find out that the sun is exploding, just for you to be sent back at the beginning, beside the campfire with your buddy roasting marshmallows. With the central mystery established, you trek along the planets for clues and information, buried deep within the skeleton of an ancient civilization. I enjoyed every discovery, and texts in the outer wilds. Each clue leads you to otherworldly vistas, or answers to questions lingering in your mind. Most of the story in the game is conveyed with the background text or environmental storytelling. Graphics and visualsThe strength of Outer Wilds visual lies in the art direction and how masterfully each location is put together. The solar system is an expansive and beautiful diorama waiting to be explored. Each planet is an otherworldly panorama that invokes a sense of wonder and excitement. Floating through space feels pretty much like you are the main character from David Bowies famous song Space Oddities. My favorite example are the Ash Twins, the first planets from the sun. They are engaged in an endless ballet of sands and gravity. Sand from one planet flows into the other, as one loses their mass, and one gains mass. The gravitational seesaw is reversed, and the sand goes back. Witnessing this celestial dance was such a marvel it made me say wow audibly while playing. The other twin rises from the horizon, bringing an enormous pillar of sand with it, as one reveals its secret buried beneath the sand, the other loses it getting buried. httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id2231269830Audio and musicThe endless vast space of Outer Wilds is carefully designed to be scarce. The void of space, is of course empty. Inside a planet though, it can range from happy and calm to a violent rage depending on where you are. Each planet has a distinct sound that their identities can be distinguished not only from what you see, but also what you hear. The Ash Twins have this constant rumbling of sands rising to the sky or falling from, Giants Deep, an ocean planet with constant raging tornadoes to calming nature sounds of Timber Hearths pine forest.The music is also scarce, but what plays usually are catchy or at least appropriate to the situation. The crew members of The Outer Wilds Ventures each broadcast their own instrument. When listened simultaneously through your radio receiver, you get a band playing cosy campfire tune. They are the reason I mostly keep the receiver on, not just to help navigate but also to feel the feeling of companionship while drifting through the empty space. ConclusionOuter Wilds is personally my undisputed king of exploration game. The joy it gave me while exploring its universe was immense. It tried to do many things and successfully triumphant over its many ambitions. The lack of meta direction from the game might leave some players clueless, it is ultimately intended to be driven by the players inner curiosity. I dont think the game is difficult but it should still be said for players who might prefer a traditional narrative instead of this type of exploration.

The best game you can only finish once.I promise once you finish youll be begging all your friends to get it and play so you can live vicariously through them. First rule of Outer Wilds, we dont talk about Outer Wilds.Second rule of Outer Wilds, if someone is talking about parts of Outer Wilds, leave the conversation immediately.This is one of those games in which the greatest enjoyment is learning for yourself. DO NOT let someone spoil it for you. This game isnt about reflexes or skill or crafting. This game is about discovery and story and marshmallows over an open fire. There are not many gems like this one. I know what youre thinking.Youve probably heard about this game. Youve probably heard that its really, really good. Youve probably also heard that even though its so good, you cannot be told anything about it before playing it. You have to go in completely blind and just take everyones word for it, and hope you enjoy it.Maybe theres a little contrarian in the back of your head thats skeptical of all this hype and sheer adoration. Maybe theres a little cynic whispering pessimistic things into your ear. Or maybe you just dont know if this will be the kind of game you will enjoy playing, and everyone being so damn cryptic about it isnt making it easy to decide if you want to spend your money on this, or instead buy whatever else it is people are recommending for a lot clearer reasons. I know at least one of these things was going on in my own head before I played.The reason its so important to go into Outer Worlds blind is because it is a game, first and foremost, about exploration. You will enter a world that is completely open to you, with the only barriers holding you back within it being the knowledge you have about it. Theoretically, you could begin the game, immediately fly to where the ending is, missing out on everything this game has to offer in terms of how it builds mystery, how it fleshes out the world, how it builds an atmosphere. Any, even partial, bit of information given to you instead of found by you would significantly diminish the experience of this game. Telling you anything about this game, except for maybe what you will see immediately after starting it, would be like telling you the solution to every single puzzle in a puzzle game.If you are anxious about if youll like it and dont know if its worth your money, do not worry. You will know if its for you before the refund period runs out, and you certainly will not regret it if you nab it on a sale. One in a MillionThats what I felt during my playthrough of Outer Wilds. I am experiencing something thats very rare and special. This one hits different.Its very difficult to talk about Outer Wilds. The less you know about this game, the better. So I wont spoil the magic. But what I love the most about Outer Wilds without revealing much, is that to progress, you do not need powerups or new skills or tools. All you need is knowledge. This is such a different game design choice from other games, I love it. I often doubted myself if I wasnt smart enough to complete this game and solve the mystery behind it. But after many difficult hours spent, I made it. Outer Wilds is masterfully done in every aspect and is an experience I will treasure for a lifetime. The soundtrack is simply amazing, they made me feel various emotions throughout my journey. I dont think it has any flaws, even though I tried finding one. httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id3214753017Being able to travel seamlessly in our solar system without any loading screens is quite a feat. Thats what a famous game studio should take as an example. And I guess we dont need 1000 planets to have an amazing experience, do we? By the way, top-notch sound design is what most indie studious can not achieve. But its implemented amazingly well here. Ive never felt this frightened in a game before. Outer Wilds has some of the greatest atmospheres in games ever.Even if you think you are stuck and can not progress anymore, please do not use Google in your time with Outer Wilds, it will only ruin the experience for you. Believe me, all the knowledge has been sprouted in the galaxy. All you need to do is read carefully and think about the things you discovered. Your curiosity is the key to progress in Outer Wilds.I cant say that this game is for everyone, but It was definitely for me. If you have a similar taste to me, or trust my taste, I definitely recommend it. Thank you Mobius Digital for creating such a masterpiece, and Annapurna Interactive for seeing the potential and supporting it.PLATINUM MEDALFollow My Curator Page A childhood dream of mine was to become an astronaut. This game, more than anything else Ive ever seen, captured the essence of that dream.Its not realistic.Its not the most innovative game Ive seen.But it is art to me.It is atmost beautiful to me.And its somewhat of a childhood dream come true.I love it and even though the developers wont ever read this review, I want to thank them. This was one of the most beautiful things Ive ever seen.Thank you so much. This game really affected me deeply. I went into it almost completely blind, as one should, and exploring space piece by piece was one of the greatest experiences Ive had in gaming. I tried my hardest not to rely on tutorials and rather figure things out by myself, and it worked almost completely. The game does exploration really well and you often do not feel truly stuck. The soundtrack, world, characters and story will definitely stick with me for the rest of my life. Highly recommended.My tip for the game is, do not look up anything about it and take your time with it, as there will be no first time ever again. oh and use the fuel refill in your ship because I didnt know about it for the first 10 hours I dont know if I have the words to properly describe my experience with Outer Wilds and the expansion.  But Im compelled to try.  An unparalleled, magical experience.  A true sense of exploration and discovery.  Wonderfully, cleverly, and beautifully crafted.  A masterwork of art.  Ill just leave it at that.  No details.  You have to at least try it.  You deserve to try it.  Best to go in completely blind. The best game Ive ever played. Dont spoil yourself. No matter what.Stop reading reviews and play the game.Venture forward into the cosmic unknown. Once in a while you come across a piece of work that you know will be with you your whole life, that youll fondly remember on your deathbed - if youre lucky enough to have your memory intact. Even more narrowly amongst those select pieces of art, once in a great while there is one which you feel transcends your personal tastes, its genre, and its medium. One which you viscerally feel every human being ought to experience and would love.Outer Wilds is exactly such a masterpiece. TLDR -- First rule of Outer Wilds you do not talk about Outer Wilds--------------------At this point Im sure youve read many reviews for this game and all of them seem to have the same template they praise this is one of the best games theyve played and its also one of the most spoiler-sensitive. Well, here is me joining the club and adding yet another similar review to the list.There is just very little you can tell about Outer Wilds that doesnt ruin the experience for newcomers. This is a space exploration game where in the first minutes of the game you will be introduced to most of the mechanics that will accompany you througout most of the journey how to fly your ship, how to use your spacesuit, how to use your tools.And thats as much as I can tell. This is a game about connecting the dots, scattered across the system. Do you feel lost? Do you feel lost even after several hours? Thats great! You are playing Outer Wilds the way intended. At some point, everything collapses, everything makes sense. But these connections are not granted nor obvious you make that happen.Mechanics-wise, Im impressed about the great job made by the developers. Physics feel natural, experimentation with them is rewarding, and the attention to detail is just insane. Music-wise, this game is incredible. It is hard to separate the music from the game. It goes along with your discoveries, making sure that what you do feels relevant when its supposed to. For whats left to say, this is basically one of the best games I have ever played. Its one of those titles you will NEVER forget, and you would pay everything to forget it and play it for the first time again. Do yourself a big favor, buy this game full price, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE LOOK FOR GUIDES OR SPOILERS and enjoy the journey of your life. This game and its lessons will stick with you forever. This is one of those experiences that you can only have once. I will never forget the time I had with this game, and I want as many people as possible to experience this. This game definitely isnt for everyone, it actually feels like it was made specifically for me and no one else, but I think everyone should at least give it a shot, on the possibility that they find it as life-changing as I did. Play it once, think about it forever. Best case scenario to play, pick it up without knowing what it is, dont look up anything about it or watch any videos until after you finished, still listen to the music years later.",
        "summary": "Outer Wilds is a spatial exploration game in a fictional solar system, mostly based on uncovering the knowledge and actions of an ancient civilization. The game is entirely based on discovery and information gathering your ship log records what you learn, and thats your progression.

        "text": "Im not writing this review to be contrary, or to try and dump on something that I understand many, many people enjoyed, I just thought Id add my review to better caution players who may be like me against buying something they might not get value out of. Honestly, Im heartbroken that I dont enjoy this game. I heard all the rave reviews, and found the premise appealing, but within a few minutes of play I had the disheartening inkling that this game would be nothing but stressful for me. I stuck it out, nearly 20 hours worth, and honestly, while I liked elements of it, it never got gratifying enough to keep at it. To put it bluntly, the controls make me want to tear my hair out. Even after a long, long adjustment period, I simply went from Hurl myself into the sun immediately every time I launch to Youll get where youre going, but have fun busting your skull open after fifteen minutes of trying to explore this fiddly platforming hellscape full of cacti for no apparent reason. I bobbled around everywhere like my spaceship was the unholy lovechild of the Mako from Mass Effect and a cursed bouncy castle. I didnt mind dying occasionally, I understand thats kind of the point, but I resented getting 90 of the way through a long convoluted section of platforming, choking on the last jump, and having to begin the loop all over again. Thinking about having to wedge my idiot jetpacked carcass through the same set of stressful maneuvers again for five new lines of dialogue was a bridge too far for me. The tipping point came when I waited ten real life minutes for an opportunity to open up, only to fudge a six foot jump, and fling myself into the sun instead. I have kids man. Every single second I get to play is a precious commodity, and every grain of my patience already spent. I just cant with this game, and I hate that. I imagine the story is very compelling, and rich, and that it really is a great experience for a lot of people, but if you arent great with complex controls, or directions, or being burnt to a crisp in the belly of a star repeatedly, then this game may not be for you. This isnt a review to bash the game, its just the review I wish Id read before I bought it. I honestly thought I would enjoy this space exploration adventure, but try as I might I just couldnt get into this game.The premise is simple you have a spaceship and a toy-sized solar system to explore. And... thats about it. This is one of those games that just throws you right into the deep end without so much as explaining what water is, let alone the concept of swimming. It counts on your own curiosity to keep driving you forward, and only provides vague and general hints about where to go next or what to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt.I think my main issue with the game is how it seems to contradict itself. The game is all about exploration and discovery, and initially seems like it would have a nice, relaxing atmosphere. But after playing for a bit, youll find that this really isnt the case. Youll realize pretty quickly that everything in this game is on a timer from your oxygen supply to changing environments and events, youre constantly either racing the clock or waiting for something to happen. And no matter what you do, the sun always explodes after 20 minutes, resetting your loop regardless.Did I mention youre in a time loop? Because youre in a time loop. Every time you die, you reset to the start of the loop, though you retain a log of your collected discoveries and knowledge. And youll die a lot. Youre defenseless in a hostile universe, and theres a lot of things that can instantly kill you. Gotta love those insta-fails. Sometimes you wont even know what hit you or what you did wrong. Combining this with the constant time pressure doesnt make for a very relaxing game.As for the actual gameplay, it basically amounts to wrangling the awkward and clunky controls into getting you from point A to point B, and then reading a bunch of exposition dumps that give you clues about what to do next. Theres some interesting environments to explore, but because youre always on the clock I eventually found myself just running through most places, scanning but not actually reading any of the text just to add it to my ships log as fast as possible. I dont think thats how youre supposed to play this game feels like it wants you to take your time with it, but then it simultaneously has a bunch of mechanics that contradict that entirely. Its just confusing.After a few hours of picking the low-hanging fruit, I found myself in a repetitive grind of trying to figure out what to do next. Revisiting areas again and again, trying to be at the right place at the right time, and to find that one thing the game still wants me to press F on to unlock the next hint. And resetting a lot in the process. Too much time in space so your oxygen runs out? Reset. Arrived too late at some specific location? Reset. Arrived too early? Enjoy waiting around for up to 15 minutes. Spent too much time at a location but havent explored everything yet? Too bad, reset. Died to environmental hazard? Reset. Fell into the black hole again? Might as well reset. Space fish? Reset. Space cactus? Believe it or not, reset. Reset, reset, reset...I have no issues with slow gameplay, but Im allergic to games that dont respect my time and unfortunately Outer Wilds is one of those games. Its a shame because I do feel theres an interesting story in here, but the gameplay is just too boring, tedious, and frustrating for me, so Id rather go do something else instead of trying to figure any more of this shit out. Imagine the best graphic adventure game youve ever played...except that every 22 minutes, you have to play an increasingly difficult game of Lunar Lander before you can get back to the graphic adventure part.If you can put up with that, the story this game tells is an amazing one.  Unfortunately, I couldnt put up with it.  The incredibly clunky ship controls plus the time limit meant that I could never relax and explore, never had time to actually think about what Id just read or seen.  I understand Im in the minority, but to anyone else who couldnt come to grips with this game  youre not alone. Im glad to have played this game, but I didnt enjoy playing it. The goodSuper creative premise, exploring a solar system and using the knowledge you acquire to solve puzzles.  Visuals are similarly really unique and show off some one-of-a-kind worlds.  Soundtrack really fits the theme and has some really fantastic tracks.The badGameplay is just not fun.  Most of the game is traveling from point A to point B with semi-realistic space flight, which means youre always fighting the controls to adjust your momentum and spend most of the game at varying degrees of upside down.  Traveling is really the only gameplay mechanic in the game, so it being awkward gets grating after a while.Everything is time-based.  You have a limited time to explore the solar system, limited oxygen, limited thruster fuel, and youre often trying to get to certain locations within specific time windows.  You will find yourself in the position of finding a new area but so low on time that youre speed-reading the information that is meant to be the reward for getting there.  In a game thats about slowly unraveling mysteries one puzzle piece at a time, having several ticking clocks pushing you forward all of the time doesnt seem appropriate.Some of the puzzles are brilliant, some are obtuse.  I loved some of the puzzles in the game, but there were a few that I still have no idea how you were meant to figure them out.  If you get stuck, there is a journal in game that will try to point you vaguely in the right direction, but it will only tell you that theres more to learn from a location.  Since a lot of those locations are literal planets with mazes inside them, youll end up backtracking for hours without stumbling upon anything new.  Some of the late-game puzzles may as well say ok just google this part then go back to the game.I am really happy for this game to do well, since it is so unusual and has such a clever premise.  And I did really enjoy the first half of the game, exploring the solar system and picking up bits of information here and there.  Once I got to the late game though, I kept finding myself wrestling the controls to rush to a location before a time window closed just to scan the same bits of information Id scanned dozens of times before and make no progress.  If you have more patience than I do, or are willing to play with a guide close at hand, you may have a better experience. Brilliantly crafted, not for me. I found it hard to care or engage with the mystery the game sets up.Its like being a vegetarian and being served a perfectly cooked steak. This is a beautiful, well-crafted game, that has some amazing moments. It makes me sad that I cannot recommend it.The gameplay loop is beyond annoying I wont give too many details to avoid spoilers. About 90 of my playtime has been retracing my steps after making one small mistake and dying a horrible death, being flung into space or something even worse. In order to progress the story, you are forced to do the same things over and over and over again. God forbid it takes you fifteen minutes to get to a location, look around it, then go back to your ship and realize there is more to explore here, because you apparently forgot to scroll over a small piece of text. Welp, fifteen more minutes of doing the same thing over again it is. This time, however, you go there and find nothing. By the third time you do it, youre already very pissed off over wasting 45 minutes of your life making zero progress. After the third failed attempt, you look up an online guide, and realize the there is more to explore here is actually an info youre gonna find in another place. Not very fun. This game made me feel overjoyed at times, but furious at others. It is with a heavy heart that I leave a negative review. I know this is going to be hugely unpopular, but the concept just doesnt work for me. Specifically, what doesnt work is the idea that I need to complete time-sensitive and coordination-based puzzles that take me a number of attempts  but when I finally beat the challenge, I dont get to reap my rewards and explore whatever was waiting for me at the end because the events of the game still flow in real time and the whole planetary system blows up after a fixed period. I spent significant effort to reach the town that is being buried under the sand  only to get like a minute to explore it before everything exploded. Thinking that Ill have to beat the whole challenge again to get another minute of exploration robs me of dopamine so drastically, I just have no motivation to continue.This is very different from games like Hollow Knight and good souls-likes, where a mastering the controls makes them very fluid and fun in Outer Wilds, they remain clunky, b the game has a rhythm where you focus on a boss or platforming challenge and then get all the time in the world to catch your breath and relax after you beat them. That rhythm, I find extremely satisfying being unable to explore at my own leisure because time is constnatly running out, I do not.Yes, I made Pathologic 2, why do you ask?In every other aspect, the game does seem brilliant. You find yourself in a Little Prince-esque planetary system that is realistically simulated and will blow up after a certain peroid of time. Your goal is to explore it  however you please  finding all kinds of secrets, information, activating obscure technogoly, and figuring out what caused the cataclysm. Then the world resets, but your findings do not.Its brilliant, and charming, and has an incredible sense of true exploration  no rails, no guidelines, just a realistic system that you can do whatever you want in. Its such a terrible shame that the combination of clunky controls and constant time limits make this exploration completely unfun to me. I dont even think the developers are at fault here  the time limit is part of the core concept. I guess the controls could have been smoother, but its clear they went for realism for the sake of immersion. In general, Id say its a case of I dont like it, but its my fault. Unfortunately, it still means I dont like it. LITMUS TEST - if you dont want to read this review because its too long, then you probably wont enjoy this game either.I purchased this game based entirely off of its overwhelmingly positive reviews, many of which encouraged me to just buy it and not look into it at all. I did so, only to later realize that it wasnt really a game for me. So heres an actual spoiler free review that you can read before you consider picking this game up. By the end of it, you will hopefully have decided whether this game is or isnt for you. To start, this is a well-designed game, I will admit. The game is very heavily exploration focused. You explore the solar system and have to unlock its secrets. The game nudges you in the right direction through its ship log, which is definitely a help. Number one, I made the mistake of marathoning this game. The first five hours were very enjoyable for me. It was all about exploration and discovering new things. In the middle part of the game, it becomes more of a task where you need to compile all of the information youve received so far and find the best way to figure out what you need to do next. The ideal way to play this game, in my opinion, is to mess around for one or two hours, and then quit so you can give it a rest for a while while you figure out what you should do next. Every bit of text in this game is important to help you understand how to progress. I wasnt fully paying attention at the beginning, so I found myself having to go back to areas I had already explored to look at the information again. The playtime you see of a lot of players is actually a bit deceitful, as a lot of extra time needs to be spent thinking about the game and not just playing it. If youre the kind of person who wants to beat a game in a few sessions or have a linear, defined progression, then I wouldnt recommend it. If youre the kind of person who doesnt want to spend a lot of time reading a lot of information and piecing it together, then I wouldnt recommend it. The end of the game involves a lot of frustration trying different things, even for hours, and not actually getting anywhere. You will end up wasting a lot of time going down one route, only to learn that wasnt what you should have been doing. Even when you learn what you should do, the game often requires that you wait long amounts of time for the right window of opportunity. If you mess it up, you have to go back and do it again. This game requires a great deal of patience, far more than the average game would. If you arent very patient when playing games, or if youre just looking for a game to invest your idle time into, I wouldnt recommend it.Looking up a guide to this game can remove the entire point of playing it. If you know how to beat it, then theres no fun anymore, which is why people say that you can only play it once. The fun is trying to discover how to do it yourself. If you dont like doing that sort of thing, and you often find yourself looking up video game guides out of frustration, then I wouldnt recommend it. However, I WOULD recommend this game to people who are intrigued by mystery and story elements. Its a very nerdy game, if that makes sense. So it has an appeal to certain people, and less of an appeal to others. If you feel like you fit into that category, then give it a go. If not, then Id steer clear. Its very well put together and a lot of thought clearly went into it. It encourages a lot of thought, but the downside and irony to that is that the more you think about it, the more you see imperfections and conveniences in the story, although I cant give examples without spoiling it. All in all, I can see how someone would really enjoy this game. I was lead to playing it because the reviewers refuse to give any context whatsoever as to the experience youll be having with this game. If I had known, I would have given it a pass. My review is to act more as a caution than an actual denouncement of this game. While this is a great game, I cannot recommend that you support the developers. They took over 126,000 from backers, promising Mac and Linux releases, and then released on the EGS, delaying the Steam release for over a year. They knew full well that they were defrauding their backers by taking Epics money, but they decided to double dip anyways. Dont support fraud. I really, really wanted to love this game. Really. After all the raving reviews I heard about it being a life-changing story-driven experience, I thought I was in for the treat of my life. What the great reviews dont tell you however, is how taxing it is for a person to get that payoff.Pros- Great soundtrack, I loved it from the moment the game booted up.- Great story. Yes it really is a very, very compelling story that is very well weaved into the game mechanics.Thats where the problem starts for me.Cons- The game is NOT a casual game. It is very mentally taxing and time-consuming. If your brain is not 100 engaged and thinking, you might actually WASTE HOURS not getting any progress. Maybe its because Im getting older and dont have as much time to spend on a game anymore, but yea, it was not something I ended up enjoying wasting my time on.- The game does not help you at all and can be a bit disengaging because you READ EVERYTHING. Loads of text with no audio make it easy to tune out to sometimes important information that is already very vague and piecemeal. In an already very time-consuming game, it is made worse because of the medium in which it presents its info.I understand why the devs made the game the way they did, I really do. I just wish someone had made it clearer that the game mayyy be a much bigger investment than many people are willing to commit to. And shamefully I admit that the only reason I could finish the game is just by following guides online because I really was not ready to waste all that time to get to the payoff. I dont mean to tell people that this is a bad game, but rather, to provide another perspective of what kind of game it is, because I am sure there are those like me who love a really good story-driven game, but just...not in this format. Sadly this game gives me the worst motion sickness . I wish I could gift it to someone else or get a refund  Im sure the game itself is great, but I just couldnt play more than 20 mins before feeling very sick  I dont recommend this game to people who have similar gaming motion sickness issues. This game, unfortunately, wasnt for me. I kept reading about how the game was life changing and had this incredible story to it. I kept wanting to look up guides and hints for the game, but every review and post I would read kept telling me to just keep playing and exploring and to not spoil it for myself. So I did. After about 13 hours I thought to myself, how much longer will this go on before the game starts to make sense? How much longer will I suffer through this frustrating exploration time loop until I have some sort of direction? When will I finally feel like the story is as incredible as everyone else makes it out to be? I just never got there, unfortunately, despite my best attempt which is really sad, per the reviews people hold this game to such high esteem. I really thought I would love this game considering the great reviews. Unfortunately, it just didnt click with me. I found myself frustrated time and again trying to figure out what to do next. I felt like I was just wasting hours of my life visiting the same planets over and over looking for one minor thing I missed. If you have the patience to do that, you will more than likely love this game. Repeating chores for little bits of info the game. Each cycle is 22 minutes out of which you will always spend 10-15 just to get to where you want to be and the rest will be spent on trying to check things out. First couple of cycles its not that bad, since novelty and not that big of distances to get to points of interest, but after that its unbearable.There is exploration here and it seem nice, but to explore a new thing you MUST RUSH ASAP or the thing will go away and youd need to do it again. Again, again and again. You dont have time to enjoy things, you always MUST RUSH. Nice blackhole? Sure, you spend 4 minutes to look at it. Now half the planet is gone. Enjoy your 10 minutes trip back next time around. Curious moving sand? Sure. But you spend extra 2 minutes looking at it didnt you? Well, now you cant get to where half the texts were sending you. Better luck next time. Oh, also your autopilot will crash you into objects just for fun, making you loose more time and restart. You better love the initial sequence chore, since you will be seeing it endless amounts of times. Ah, also you cant mark things freely. Found that neat shortcut? Cool, you better make a screenshot and memorise the hell out of it.Thanks game! Jesus, nothing on this page says anything about strict timer. I was hoping to see what was so good about this game that it got that 95, I tried to give this game a chance. Maybe there was a way to prolong the timer, I said to myself, maybe there can be something that will give me a moment of respite to you know... explore? Nope, you just RUN ASAP to get you that miniscule bit of story text or your restart. Thats it.Yeah, art direction is nice. Story bits are nice as well, if you amass enough of them to piece them together. Puzzles are easy. Controls are a bit clunky, but you can get used to it. Everything but this dam ned RUSH is fine. Only for this I really dont like the game.I have my real life with endless loop. Hell, even two endless loops - work and family. I just wanted to explore the mysterious beautiful world. But if I need to RUN, Ill just do it in real life. Outer Wilds is a game primarily focused on exploration, reading snippets of lore, and bringing those together to find out where to go next. Its been described as a slow burn, so it takes a very patient approach to become invested. There is a rumor system to help journal areas where the player should explore next, and the main draw of the game is to satisfy your curiosity for whats next by poking around. This game is for you ifYou enjoy exploration as a primary focus.You read everything and speak to everyone in games that you play, and take your own notes.You enjoy games that deliver information through disconnected snips of lore.You dont mind backtracking.You dont mind leaving the game to find clues or hints online.This game isnt for you ifYou enjoy learning mechanics and then expressing a tight mastery and flow of those mechanics, as in combat or platforming.You enjoy tight pacing.You tend to skim over the reading of ingame notes and dialogue.You enjoy plotting based on interpersonal relationships or personal conflict.You dont mind poking around with no progress.If youve finished the game and are reading this, congratulations! I can say with honesty that after I finished, Id rate my enjoyment as a shallow bell curve struggling heavily at the beginning to find a hook, getting interested in the history and lore toward the middle, and then really struggling with the tedium and my disinterest with the plot at the end. Based on so many glowing reviews, I expected the game to wow me at the end, but I feel it ended exactly as it started. I wish I hadnt wasted my time. I know this is an unpopular opinion since most people love this game but reasons I didnt like the overall experience are the same reasons many others really like this game. I cant give any specific examples to avoid spoilers so Ill have to stick with being vague. Im coming from the perspective of an adult gamer in his mid 30s with a lot less time to play than I used to. Younger me would have loved this game but since I only have time to play 4-5 hours per week so game mechanics to save time like quick saving, check points, and fast travel are really helpful to me. Not having all or any of those mechanics doesnt kill a game for me but there are a lot of tedious and repetitive things that need to be done to solve some of the puzzles especially towards the end of the game that really ruined the immersion for me. There are multiple areas where it takes 10-15 minutes of waiting for correct timing in the time loop or needing to get past multiple obstacles where one mistake forces you to reset the time loop and start over. If you have a lot of time to play the game those issues are no big dial and part of the difficulty of the game but I see it as just burning through my limited free time. Additionally, there are some game mechanics to solve some of the puzzles that require a lot of trial and error which doesnt bother me too much except that in order to try another variation of the same way to solve the puzzle, you have to start over the time loop and wait for the opportunity again. If there are 5 ways to try something it should only take a few minutes but because there is no quick save or check points the time loop reset can force you to repeat all the stuff you just did over the last 10 minutes. Unfortunately, I ended up looking up a guide to figure out what the specific game mechanic was because I couldnt get to the next section even though I already figured out how to do it and I didnt have 30-45 minutes worth of time loop resetting to figure out if I was doing something a couple seconds too early or too late,  I did something too fast or too slow, or some other thing slightly off.TLDR This is not a good game to play if you are unable to play for longer periods or very often because the repetitiveness and trial and error nature of some of the puzzles is fairly time consuming compared to the time spent discovering new things and actual puzzle solving. At some point I began wondering if Ive been playing this game wrong, because every time I get anywhere I get killed and have to virtually start over with incrementally more knowledge to work with. While I dont advocate for a game holding your hand, this game gives very little to work with. Im sure Outer Wilds is awesome, but I let all the positive reviews woo me into playing a type of game I had no reason to think I would like- so this is a warning to others not to do the same. Continuing just felt like a chore to me.EDIT I tried the game again, this time on a new play-through and I got a lot farther. Still felt like a chore to me at the end of the day though, so while its an awesome game just be aware its definitely not for everyone. The amazing sense of exploration in the first few hours is completely undone by all the busywork and redoing the same things over and over again because you missed a jump by one inch or you were just a few seconds too late for a timed event. The puzzles mostly come down to how do I get to that place? And after you figure out the how, redoing it over and over again because you ran out of time or just slightly messed up.For instance, there is a planet called Brittle Hollow that slowly disintegrates as the loop progresses. To get to a specific room in Brittle Hollow, you first have to go inside the planet, activate a switch, go to another planet, wait around for a specific moment, then teleport back to Brittle Hollow to get to the room. If at any point during this sequence you miss a jump, or take too long doing something, or your autopilot decides to hurl you into the sun, you get to do it all over again.Its such a shame The first few hours were the best exploration game I ever played. I absolutely loved it and was ready to sings this games praises to everyone I know. But the game has zero respect for your time and dulls its mystery with tedium and busywork. Im glad this exists but Im never going to finish it. Theres a huge amount to enjoy in Outer Wilds. The story is amazing, the ending is superb, its got great music, and its set in a beautiful open world thats wonderful to explore.I loved that there arent power ups or xp or better equipment, youre totally free to explore anywhere you want from the start and its only the knowledge you gather along the way that makes you more powerful.So its a real shame that I didnt enjoy playing it.For me thetime loop mechanic sapped the fun out of the game. I wanted to be free to explore and it made me feel rushed and pressured. It was worst when there were other time pressures, such as on the Stranger or Ember Twin. I felt penalised for exploring and experimenting, because doing that meant I was wasting time. It also meant I had to replay the same stuff again and again, making trying something new to solve a puzzle or figure things out really tedious. Outer Wilds would be vastly improved my some sort of pick up where you left off option. I thought the time loop mechanic was creative and I really liked the role it played in the story, but I would have enjoyed the gameplay far more without it.The loading screen is also not kidding when it says best played with a controller. The mousekeyboard controls were not pleasant to use. I also found the game ran badly, not what I was expecting considering the cartoon graphics.I really wanted to like Outer Wilds but by the end I was so fed up and frustrated I was just googling what to do with the last few challenges because I wanted to finish the game as quickly as possible. As much as I wanted to like this game I just cant bring myself to, maybe its just me being a lazy gamer but I dont want to work as hard as this game makes me for story. The controls on both controller and keyboardmouse were near impossible to use for me. While the characters, when you do find them are cute and compelling for me its just not worth the tortuous journey of navigating inside the rocket and landing on their planet. If I hadnt read all of the glowing reviews prior to playing I wouldve felt less disappointed when I just didnt gel with it but unfortunately that wasnt the case. I still recommend you try this game for yourself because I see so much to be enjoyed about it the art syle, graphics, adorable characters and dialogue options but for the sake of this review I dont. I hope that you do enjoy it, I just couldnt.",
        "summary": "The controls make me want to tear my hair out. I stuck it out, nearly 20 hours worth, and honestly, while I liked elements of it, it never got gratifying enough to keep at it. This is one of those games that just throws you right into the deep end without so much as explaining what water is, let alone the concept of swimming."

Ive been going through a tough time recently and lost interest in the things I used to enjoy, like video games.During the last Steam sale, I remembered this game. It had been on my wishlist for a while, so I decided to buy it, even though I didnt really feel like playing. I gave it a try and played for a few minutesuntil I noticed a calendar on the wall with my birthday on it October 11th.For some reason, that small detail motivated me to keep playing. Over time, I found myself playing more and more. It took me a few weeks, but today I finally finished it. It may not seem like much, but completing this game feels like a real accomplishment after many setbacks in life.This game helped me rediscover my love for video games. A heartfelt thank you to the developer for creating this masterpiece. A one-of-a-kind game that must be experienced, but the current price and the games length might deter some players. Its very much in the same vein as Inside, Limbo, and Little Nightmares in terms of style and the hours spent.Considering this is the studios first game, you really appreciate the incredible job they did with Stray. The graphics, atmosphere, lighting, sound design, and especially the animations are top-notch and AAA quality. While the gameplay is basic and doesnt offer much beyond light exploration, I find it refreshing, especially since weve never had the chance to play as an agile cat before. The levels feature a lot of verticality, which fits perfectly for a cat-themed game. The robots feel more human than the actual humans in many other games, which is a great achievement in conveying emotion.For me, quality  quantity, and Stray delivered on that without hesitation. I had more fun playing this game in 6 hours than in my 140-hour Assassins Creed playthrough. If the current price is a concern, Id recommend waiting for the first big discount season.Im hoping for a DLC or a sequel in the futureand perhaps even a way to customize your cat! Just to let you know part of the games price goes to take care of street cats. You should not pirate this game. Some say its a short game, that they completed in 3 hours. But i took my time, looked in every corner, talked to every robot and completed the game in 7 hours, yet i still didnt find 100 of the memories. Its a wholehearted game, incredibly passionate, it was a pleasure. I think the reason a lot of these reviews are quite short is because Stray needs to be experienced. Its not just a game its emotion and state of mind.Stray has been built with love and care, and those elements are reflected in the narrative, the graphics, and the soundtrack which I now listen to for relaxation regularly. There are dark aspects, but that makes you appreciate the light moments even more. The simple things in life. I never thought I would be so happy to be in a vividly depicted disintegrating slum, until I returned there from visiting a truly dark and dangerous place.This is more than a cat simulator. The cat is but one of the endearing non-human characters who carry the story along. One of the loveliest things about Stray is that it contains no spoken human language - the characters communicate in meows, beeps and bloops, and you get a text feed of what the robots are saying. The developers have also managed to make the electronic noises expressive of emotion. Its very well done, and part of what makes Stray so soothing to play. Sitting in a comfy seat with the lights dimmed, sipping on a hot drink, was immensely enjoyable for me. It was a relief. Some quiet time to exercise my brain and figure out the puzzles throughout Stray, all the while loving the characters and the story. My wife got into it too and we put our heads together to work out some of the puzzles.Yes, the playtime of Stray is short. But as I mentioned earlier, its an experience, not just a game. Like a nice slow interactive movie which is absolutely adorable. It makes you think about the human condition, even though it contains no biological humans. All the while, youre a cat. From getting into trouble, to curling up next to your robot companions, the spectrum is covered. I cried at the end. Stray is a masterpiece. Thank you BlueTwelve Studio. I know this review will be lengthy, but I hope you stick around to read the reason why I adore this game, as it is very personal to me.Firstly, a game like this is the last kind of game someone like me would buy. Im not big on puzzle games, chill games and the like, certainly not games where I play as a cat. I like the action, shooter, strategy kind of stuff. So why would someone like me buy a game like this?Well, let me start by saying something even weirder Im not a cat person. Or at least, there was a time I wasnt. Then one day at work, in the auto detailing shop I work in, a stray cat wandered into our shop, pregnant with a litter. My mom managed to catch her, bring her into one of the rooms of our shop, and turn it into a place to take care of her kittens until they were able to be given away. We designated the mama cat Mama Kitty, and eventually called her Mama for short. After we got them homes, we got her fixed so she couldnt have kittens anymore. During this time, I was going through a lot of depression problems, and once again, the last thing I expected was a cat would be a companion in this time, but Mama Kitty became just that.After her kittens were all gone, she fell into a deep depression, and was alone in that room. I watched her, and my heart sank. For her, her kittens all moved on, were given new homes, and she was left here, alone. I related to exactly how she felt, feeling like everyone around you was moving on with life but you couldnt. We tried to get her a home, but it didnt work out. She just wasnt an indoor cat. So what happened? She ended up staying in our shop, literally making the whole shop her home. She followed me almost everywhere I went, and for two years, I would come into work and there was Mama Kitty waiting for me to feed her, and fill her day with love, affection and joy. She found a home, and she found peace at our shop, and for me, helping her move on with her life, no longer needing to worry about kittens, and getting to just be a free-spirited cat, was all I needed to help me with my own depression. She fit in so well. She would literally just find a spot in the shop, lay there and watch you work, and occasionally want so much attention, shed interrupt your work, demanding you pet her, or feed her.Why do I speak in past tense? About five or six months ago, Mama Kitty disappeared. One Friday she was there, on Saturday gone. She had gone off many times before, but was always back by the end of the day, and she had this little makeshift bed in a bush that she slept in every night, and napped in every day. She was just gone, and I have never seen her since. The Monday after she disappeared was the hardest day of them all. It was the first day coming back to work and she was not there waiting for me. I didnt want to be there, falling apart, trying not to let people see me an emotional, pitiful mess. My little Mama Kitty was gone. I miss her meow which the cat you play as in this game reminds me so much of, her playfulness, and just how spoiled she was.I dont know where Mama Kitty is, or if she is even still alive. By now, Ill never know what happened to her unless she miraculously turns back up at the shop. Cats have been known to do that, particularly strays. The other day I caught myself wondering if she wandered off for the last time, got herself into serious trouble, and then died all alone, without me to be there with her in her last moments, and it eats me up to think about. I loved that cat with all my heart. But I know at least I can have the peace of mind that I did everything I could to give her a wonderful life while she had it, even if it was two short years.  I dont regret it, and I pray shell come back to that same life.Thats why this game hits me on a personal level that no game does. When I heard about this game, I was immediately reminded of Mama Kitty, and just had to get it. For the first time in my life, a game has reached me on an intimately emotional level. Thank you to these developers for making this game. I bought this game for Mama Kitty, in remembrance of her and how much she helped me as I did my best to give her the best little life I could. This game is a joy to my heart, helping me with the memory of my own cat, a little stray, whom I had the privilege of loving. Because of this game, instead of letting them go back to a shelter, I am making the 64-hour round trip to pick up my brothers two cats from across the country. Waukegan, IL to San Diego, CA or bust. I am heading off August 5, or whenever I finish the game whichever is faster. update soon!update 852022 - game not finished, but for safety, i have gotten help for this trip. so much help in fact that this is going to be a flight, no longer a road trip. big bro marine will be coming home alongside his kitties. cleaning and moving furniture to get new and old cats to know each other but safely.update 8162022 last night in San Diego, kitties are okay! going home tomorrow 5PM sharp!!!update 8202022 cats are introduced, check pfp. 1110 great game Just press a bunch of buttons Easy Significant brain usage Easy to learn  Hard to master Difficult Dark SoulsGRAPHICS - MS-DOS Awful Bad Will do Good Nothing special Beautiful MasterpieceAUDIO - Bad Not too bad Decent Good Beautiful MasterpieceGAMEPLAY - Bad Okay Nothing special Good Very good Try not to get addictedAUDIENCE - Kids Teens Adults EveryoneSTORY - NoneNot important in this game Bad Average Good Lovely One of the best ive had the pleasure of playingPRICE - Free Cheap Under priced Acceptable price Overpriced Complete waste of moneyLENGTH - Very Short 0 - 4 hours Short 4 - 10 hours Average 10-30 hours Long 30-50 hours if you go for everything in the game Extremely long 50-100 hours No endingFUN - Id rather watch paint dry Hard to enjoy Repetitive Actually pretty amusing The kind of fun youll remember Ride of your lifeREPLAYABILITY - Its a one-time experience Only for achievements If you wait a few monthsyears tens of times Definitely Infinitely repayablePC REQUIREMENTS- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computerBUGS - Never heard of Minor bugs Can get annoying Bugs-galore avoid at all costsWORTH BUYING - No Wait for sale Yes You play as a cat.You can purr.You can scratch walls and carpets.You can put your head into paperbags.You can purr.What else do you need in this crazy world right now...Thanks for this game 3 I never knew the perfect cat game existed, but after sinking over twelve hours into Stray, I now know it does. As a cat lover and owner, playing as a cat felt like an absolute dream. I really hope they release some DLC or a sequel. Id give this a 910 minus one point because I couldnt swipe food off the counter like my tabby loves to do As a cat lover, this game gave me mixed emotions of joy and sorrow. Despite how short the game is, the story, the simple graphics, the emotion aura, and finally the ending, are overwhelmingly great.I strongly recommend this game, especially for cat lovers. I am a single dad with a five year old daughter.  I do not know anything about computer games or video games - the last time I played one was over a decade ago in college.  But I wanted something new for us to be able to do together, and someone recommended this.  Im very glad they did.Together, we completed Stray in about eight hours over the course of about ten days, as kids dont have long attention spans.  I learned new things about my daughter in the process.  She is clever, creative, and compassionate.  The story provides learning opportunities about hope, friendship, and the virtue of sacrifice.  And she absolutely loved taking turns with me playing and watching.I cannot review this game highly enough.  Its an exceptional choice for parents, even for parents with younger kids.  But better yet, I never felt like I was playing a kids game.  In fact, this was more than a game, it was an opportunity to bond even closer to my daughter.  Im never going to be a gamer, but maybe Ill try to find another game for me and my daughter to play very soon. --- Graphics --- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it MS-DOS--- Gameplay --- Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Watch paint dry instead Just dont--- Audio --- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Im now deaf--- Audience --- Kids Teens Adults Grandma--- PC Requirements --- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer--- Game Size --- Floppy Disk Old Fashioned Workable Big Will eat 10 of your 1TB hard drive You will want an entire hard drive to hold it You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data--- Difficulty --- Just press W Easy Easy to learn  Hard to master Significant brain usage Difficult Dark Souls--- Grind --- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboardsranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding--- Story --- No Story Some lore Average Good Lovely Itll replace your life--- Game Time --- Long enough for a cup of coffee Short Average Long To infinity and beyond--- Price --- Its free!

Here you will have the chance to do what a cat does best meow, explore, scratch and annoy other characters.You play as a nameless orange cat that gets separated from his family and trapped in a strange, underground city full of humanoid robots. You will explore this world, meet some allies and try to both escape the sealed settlement and help your new friends with their ultimate mission.Since this is about a main character and protagonist, Im referring to our furry friend as a he, not an it.Gameplay is fun and its short length prevents it from becoming boring or tedious. Still, I would have loved to play more in this wondrous world along with this smart feline. I clocked 9.8 hours at a leisurely pace, exploring the detailed environments and enjoying the experience. I managed to collect every object on my first run, and only missed a couple of memories. The puzzles are simple but effective, completely logical in its solving requirements, and make sense within the story needs. There is an adequate mix of platforming, puzzle-solving, NPC-interacting, exploring, sneaking and fighting to keep everyone entertained.This game nails the experience of being a cat. You can meow, purr, climb, fit through tight places, scratch various surfaces, push things off tables and shelves, walk on keyboards to produce satisfying gibberish, mess around with board games, sleep on surprising spotseven on top of peopleand destroy stuff and, most importantly, steal a smile from NPCs when you nuzzle up against them.The cats movements and animations are not perfect, yet still superbly done. He can realistically run, dash and trot lick its paws, stretch, orient its ears and stare at stuff just like a real cat would. The animations are quite natural and a joy to look at. Only the sleeping position is not quite precise--a cat does not curl its back legs like a dog would, but this is a minor detail.Environments are detailed, varied and gorgeous. Each chapter has its very own ambience, distinguishable from the rest. The contrast between the organic and the machine is strong and meaningful, and the textures, colors, the lighting, even the platforming and exploration styles are defined per area. Most of them are relatively small and manageable, but still require attention if you are to discover all of Strays secrets. Collectibles abound, and while they are by no means numerous, they are missable and backtracking wont be an option in several cases, unless you are willing to replay a chapter from the beginning.The story is good, bittersweet and sad not very predictable. It is simple but it works, and leaves a lot for the player to reflect. Echoes of the global pandemic, ecological disaster and human hubris can be seen and heard everywhere, while still maintaining a fresh look on a post-apocalyptic Earth. There are lots of details, and the story is not directly handed to the playeryou will have to make your own conclusions about the past, the present and the future. To me, this is not a bad thing. Rather, it is a sign of a sophisticated storyteller knowledgeable of current trends. Dramatically, the story delivers.The graphical settings are somewhat basic, and several advanced options are entirely missing.  Some people will miss stuff like ray tracing, vignette, depth of field and such. Personally, I play in a big monitor and would have loved the option to tweak the field of viewsometimes it feels too narrow, and motion-sickness might ensue. Nevertheless, the game looks beautiful.The music and sounds are greatsome of them quite alien, as would be expected from a futuristic robot culture. It succeeds in setting the mood and tone for each situation and area, from the depressing and tranquil to the scary and suspenseful.Since the protagonist is completely background-less and anonymous, Stray could have benefited from fur and eye color customization. That element alone would have done wonders for the player to bond and care more about their cat.I paid full price with a 10 off for pre-order, and dont regret it. It is in no way an outrageous amount for current standards, considering many games today are released costing three or four times that. Be not mistaken experience-wise, the storytelling is carefully tailored here. Like a movie or a good short story, its quality is not defined by the overall length. It would be unfair to compare Stray to storyless, open-world games.Overall, I found Stray to be a great experience, with interesting gameplay and characters, and a fresh alternative to other dystopian, post-apocalyptic games. Playing as a cat is satisfying and novel.Mischievously recommended. pspspspspsppspspspsps Stray is one of those, once in a generation games, along the lines of Portal.  The game mechanics arent anything ground breaking, but the environment and story is truly something to experience yourself.  The game makes you feel.  The game makes you think.  The gravity of the game is one that takes place in the future, but is still close enough to today that it feels possible.In terms of being a cat - It is apparent right from the get-go that the developers spared no expense to capture exactly what it means to be a cat.  I would often find myself saying, Ohhh BIG JUMP!! and Ooooo BIG STRETCH!  The amount of awwws coming from those who watched me play were too many to count.You can feel the atmosphere of this game.  There is no HUD, Just a kitty cat and his kitty buddy robot drone bro.  You can speed through this game and knock it out in 2 hours, but that would be on par with watching a wonderful movie on fast forward just for the sake of finishing it sooner.  Do not simply play this game - Experience  this game.  Dim the lights, turn off your phone, close the blinds, use your best pair of headphones or speakers and get lost in a masterpiece of feline eloquence.Press B to Meow If you discover this game presuming its all about exploring a mesmerizing open world as a meowing, purring, ginger cat that can vertically climb and scratch surfaces, like its some sort of simple cat simulator game, then Im afraid to tell you that its far from the truth!  Stray is so much more. Stray also features equally as much gross areas to explore, areas infested with enemies which will require you to be stealthy, and ultimately a compelling story! All those beautiful screenshots youll encounter of Stray online are generally from the very beginning, the very end and most commonly, from an area near the end of the game called Midtown! Theyre just snippets of 3 chapters part of a larger 12 chapter game!This raises the question of what exactly is Stray then. Let me explain. About Stray Stray is a gripping, short adventure game where youll be playing in third person as an unnamed, stray, ginger cat who becomes separated from their cluster as a result of falling from a loosened pipe, deep down to an unfamiliar world. In this new world,  roam different types of robots. Youll first meet companion robots, which are  highly-intelligent, bipedal robots with different personalities and their own respected language. They are notably slow and weak at defending themselves from predators such as zurks which are enemies youll often encounter and have to evade throughout the game. Because of their limitations, companion robots have confined themselves to a small safe zone in which most of them refuse to leave. Within the safe zone are a few outsider companion robots who wish to reach where the cat came from - which is the surface, but the companions refer to it as the outside . However, all but one outsider companion robot is inside of the safe zone when you initially arrive to the safe zone so you must track the rest of the outsiders down and follow their leads to possibly get back to the outside. Will the ginger cat survive and make it back to the surface and reunite with their cluster? Play to find out! My Review of Stray I have to say, this game exceeded my expectations. For starters, I wasnt expecting chases and having to hide from enemies. In fact, I blindly got into this game expecting no enemies at all. So, these elements really caught me off-guard but  in the end I had fun getting past the zurks and sentinels, it made the gameplay experience all more thrilling and intense, fueling my eager desire to get back to the surface. In the about section, I just scratched the surface of the plot - what I shared was just the tip of the iceberg. The plot is what really intrigued and left a profound impression on me other than the outstanding visuals of this game. Its such a deep rabbit hole that I didnt see coming. The plot really deserves as much as credit as the graphics.  Learning that - The entire map was  a closed cylindrical space called Walled City 99 , - Humans  died out from a plague breakout and that the last humans lived within this confined space along with the companions  , - There is a sort of caste system in which inhabitants live in an elevated level with respect to their hierarchy ,-  Some of the last remaining humans became companions or entered themselves into the network,-   B-12 was initially the Scientists assistant and then the consciousness of the Scientist , were details that all shook me. I was not expecting such a rich story. If youre as fascinated by the story as I am, then I encourage you to collect all of B-12s memories or to alternatively learn more about the plot from the Stray Wiki. And of course, I cant finish this section without mentioning the graphics, the visuals - the things that truly carry this game. The game is full of many areas with colorful lighting  - which is very admirable, but if I have to be honest, while the game has an abundance of orange, red, blue and other colored lights,  there arent many areas containing beautiful scenery - the perfect places to use as background footage for your screenshots. I was a bit disappointed in this aspect.  As a result of this, my number one destination for photography was naturally the Midtown. So, I wish there were more beautiful areas on the map to explore. Nonetheless, the overall aesthetic of the game is stunning, even if all areas cant be used for picture-perfect moments.  My Pain Point About Stray Theres only one thing that Im dissatisfied about Stray which is how we arent able to go into first person. The feature to zoom in your camera felt really pointless to me because part of the cats body would appear in the shot and kind of ruin it so I dont think I took any shots by zooming in. If we were able to enter first person, I wouldve taken so much more screenshots and would have put the zooming in feature into use. So, the ability to enter first person should really be introduced.Signing off with some screenshots I took, feel free to leave them a like!httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id3437011326httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id3437762398httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id3439362917 Overall Rating 910 The DEVS donate a nice portion of the profits to various cat shelters and charities. Even if the game was ass, id give it a thumbs up JUST for that reason alone.But the game is also amazing.",
        "summary": "This game helped me rediscover my love for video games. The graphics, atmosphere, lighting, sound design, and especially the animations are top-notch and AAA quality. While the gameplay is basic and doesnt offer much beyond light exploration, I find it refreshing. The levels feature a lot of verticality, which fits perfectly for a cat-themed game."

        "text": "Stray is no masterpiece.I first heard about Stray from the Game Awards. I usually like to keep up to date with playing the top releases of the year so I kept it in the back of my mind. Then the Steam Awards roll around too and what do you know, Stray is nominated not only for its innovative gameplay but also for another GOTY slot. And oh my God,  I have to feel like the nominations are more of a consolation prize than anything else. Stray has a singular shtick to it. This game is not engaging, it is not innovating, and it is definitely not a 1010 experience. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but making your character model a cat alone doesnt make it compete with God of War or Elden Ring. I regularly find myself wondering the reason behind somethings popularity. In this case, I know the exact reason and its not exactly a head-scratcherLets lead the discussion on that innovative gameplay. Stray is a compiled mess of genres including puzzle-solving, platforming, chase sequences, stealth segments, and optional collectibles. Every single one of these gameplay elements is either mind-numbingly simple or barebones in implementation. The platforming is all automated, you can only jump when and where the game wants you to. The stealth segments are so laughably bad I just ran past them with no regard for actually sneaking. The puzzles hold your hand throughout every step of the way, with only half of them involving more than a single step. I think the most engaging puzzle involved stealing clothes from a store, which a cat is very clearly capable of devising a plan for. The open-ended areas Ive heard about in other reviews are a complete lie. The game is one of the most linear releases Ive played this year. Combat is literally just flashing light on enemies and they explode. I think Ill steal a quote from the games Wikipedia page on what you can expect from the gameplay Optional activities include sleeping, meowing, and nuzzling up to NPCs. There are amazing games out there that are relaxing like Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing but you get the exact same experience out of Stray by watching a silent YouTube playthrough. Stray is a borderline walking simulator that people overhype because you play as a cat. Stray isnt even a cat simulator because the movement and mechanics dont take advantage of any ideas that playing as a cat could offer. Stray would play the exact same if you played as a dog or a frog.httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id2910500426Which sort of segues into my next point. The story absolutely hates that you are a cat. There are dialogue dumps piled on top of each other just to tell the most generic apocalypse story. The plot moves and revolves around your robot companion that really shouldve been the main character. The cat is just sort of there and yet its portrayed as the savior of this dystopian world. I fully cannot believe that the discount headcrabs are a threat when meowing produces enough force to knock them off. So many ideas are thrown around with the plot like the aforementioned meat blobs and tiny police officer sentinels. The sentinels are the most generic Big Brother type police state with no personality, no motivation, and no background. Theyre just there. Theres also one story bit where a character betrays you for the mere sake of shock value. The motive behind said betrayal makes no sense when theyre implicating themselves more than you by turning you in to the police. The characters are all flat and one-dimensional, which wouldnt be an issue if the plot focused on the cat and not freeing a chained city. Stray desperately wants to tell a story that has nothing to do with cats. So I just gotta ask Why not just make a cyberpunk game?httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id2910498681The answer to why Stray so desperately wants to be two distinct things is rather simple. It also answers the questions as to why Stray has exploded in popularity and why the developers chose to make the player character a cat. Casual gamers will eat it up if you get to play as a cute cat. A lot of the praise that Stray gets is from the crowd that doesnt really play video games. Most of the coverage I see for the games comes from mainstream media outlets like CNN, Vice, or the New York Times. The game plays itself nature I mentioned earlier combined with a cute cat is enough for people to call mediocrity a masterpiece. Stray has nothing to offer past its cat gimmick. If you were not sold on playing as a cat in a pseudo-walking simulator, you will not enjoy Stray. And while thats okay in the grand scheme of things, its not innovating. The one area I can praise Stray for is the visuals. The graphics are absolutely stellar and are on par with AAA games. For an indie studio, this is incredibly impressive. So many indie games give up on having realistic graphics entirely and focus on being gorgeous with pixel art, a low poly aesthetic, or just having a really vibrant and unique style. The cyberpunk setting is given amazing attention to detail and character models were almost never recycled. I really like that the robotic NPCs all had their own clothes, screens, colors, and personal style. Their humanity and individuality lie intact despite their robotic shell. I find it a huge shame that the camera only wants to focus on a quarter of the scenery because youre so small. It doesnt help that the cities feel lifeless not because theyre populated only with robots but because the NPCs all just sit there and do nothing. The soundtrack is also really annoying. I was unsure if it was actually bugged for me or not because every single song was a 10-second loop. After actually listening to the soundtrack outside of the game, I am pretty certain that this is likely the case. But the songs arent that impressive regardless and I wont be listening to the OST any time soon.httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id2910498948Performance is something I feel rather iffy about. While I never had any crashes or bugs, this is the game that has overworked my computers fans the most. While the game is gorgeous, it is nowhere near the most intensive game Ive played. Also, theres pretty bad clipping when it comes to the cats model. Basically anything you interact with you can have some part of yourself clip into. The most entertainment I got from the game was attempting to wear the glitchiest box I could find. Objects would go flying with full force randomly at times as well. The most irritating bug I found involved a pot getting permanently stuck inside the floor and it constantly tried to readjust itself. This resulted in the most ear-screeching noise Ive heard in a while.Thats really all there is to Stray. I cannot stress this enough, Stray is an automated platformer with minimal character interactions and puzzle-solving for 3rd graders. No one would be talking about Stray if you didnt play as a cat. The game took me a little longer than 4 hours with me spending some extra time in the chapter select to snag a few easy achievements. Its a catastrophic mess of mediocrity. Its not bad because it falls flat with its ideas, but because it didnt try any to begin with. If not for its impressive visuals, this game would have nothing worth talking about. I personally believe that the other nominees for GOTY will be talked about for years if not decades to come. But I struggle to see discussions for Stray lasting far into next year. Im giving the game a score of 310. Not the worst, but nowhere near the best. greatly overrated, yeah, me too i like cats and robots.game is repetitive, short and directive.If main character wasnt a cat, no way this game would have overwhelmingly positive reviews. An utterly beautiful game let down by its ending  we never see Stray re-unite with its family . This is a very remorseful thumbs down, and as the other reviews show, there is SO much to enjoy here.We really didnt need much to bring the games emotional through-line to fruition. Our cat makes friends and comes to care about the lives of the Outsiders and the city, but they are ultimately a means to an end of escaping the city. It just so happens our goals align. But from the outset we are driven to accomplish one thing, kicked off by our unfortunate entry into the city. The sad, desperate mewls of your friends underscore the emotional goal,  to get back to your loved ones no matter what .Sadly, the writers are much more interested in the plight of the robots, which seeks to supplant Strays goal with their goals. I played this with my partner sat beside me, and she was extremely invested in  re-uniting the family , which kept her hooked. When the final scene concludes, and we fade to black, we were shocked. Where was the culmination of all wed strived for? We felt robbed. I suppose the success of Stray will result in a DLCsequel that might cover this. If they provide a free update that finishes Strays story, Ill be delighted to update this review as a big ol thumbs up. As it is now, I recommend that people who invest in story-driven games avoid this. The most overrated game of 2022.Traversal is predetermined, meaning the cat can only jump towards set paths.Puzzles are brain dead that can be solved by people with 1 brain cell.Enemies just chase and jump towards you and are easy to escape.Collectables are a joke that only give small insights to the setting.All in all, its only popular cause it has a cat. Strip that away and its an extremely linear, gimmicky platformer with good visuals.The fact this game received Most innovative award, is a joke. I feel if the game didnt have a cat as the main character it wouldnt be popular at all. Its not a great game and the story is as generic as they come. Not terrible, but not half as good as it could have, should have, been.Super linear. Cant design our own cat.My wife who insisted I buy this game stopped caring within 20 minutes of launching it.This isnt a be a cat game. This is a walking simulator played as a cat. pluses- you play as a cat, and the cat animations are cute- the city is pretty- The game is extremely accessible and easy to playnegatives- the game is very short. I spent a fair bit of time looking around in the first half, and was still done in 5 hours. Im sure if Id spent less time looking for collectibles it may have been 3 or 4- The gameplay is hardly extensive. Guess thats the cost of the accessibility.- outside of hunting for randomly placed collectibles theres no real replay value to be seenIts a decent experience but for the price its not exactly great value Stray is a game that makes me sad, and not for the reasons the developer intends. It makes me sad because its one of those experiences that have some very polished parts that really stand out in a muddle of other parts that have no idea what theyre doing or why theyre there.To start with the good parts, the visual design and the cat animations are really good. Sounds are with one notable exception... crisp, clear and contribute to enjoying the game. And thats kind of it for the good parts.Visually, any time theres a close-up of the cat, theres a weird bit of uncanny valley going on. It just doesnt look entirely like a cats face, like its stuck somewhere between cartoon cat and real cat in just the wrong spot, and one notable hazard youll be dealing with a lot in the early gamethe Zurks look like a cheap asset store model compared to everything else. Said hazard is also the source of the worst piece of sound design in the game, what Im 99 sure is literally just the Halflife 1 Snark chirp looted without even filing off the serial numbers.What about the story, though? And the vibes? Does it feel like youre playing as a cute cat? Because we all love cute cats. I love cute cats, and the moments where I felt I was playing as a cute cat felt... far between. And this all kind of ties into the gameplay, so its going to be one big mixed section.The issue is that much like the visuals, the game cant decide if youre a cat cat, as in a real cat, or some sort of more-intelligent cartoon cat. At points youre just doing very cat thigns, like knocking stuff off shelves and hopping on things to get to tall places, scratching on stuff which coincidentally solves puzzles. This is generally where the game shines.Where the game shines less is when youre doing fetch quests for NPCs in distinctly un-cat-like ways, dealing with hazardous enemies or even worse the very short section where youre blowing enemies up with a laser gun. It thankfully ends after a very brief period, which makes it feel even more baffling, like half the dev team didnt actually want it in there. And this whole we dont know why its in there or what were trying to say-thing carries over to the story and the gameworld as well. Heavy spoilers ahead.Why is Meat Cthulhu underneath the city? Why does it have a thousand eyes? Is it intelligent? Is it just meat? Who knows.Why are a bunch of robots acting like a police state? Are they acting on anyones orders? Are they just unpleasant robo-people? Why even HAVE a city full of robots if theyre never distinct from people? The games robots drink, apparently have children, talk about eating food, etc. so at no point does it really seem to matter that theyre robots.It even fails to nail the ending, trying to get emotional responses out of the player with some things that are either COMPLETELY unearned Clementines goodbye or so insanely telegraphed that it feels like an eyerolly cliche yes, of course, someone dies just at the threshold of victory. Play for ten minutes and you can probably guess who.Even the controls are kind of schizophrenic. Like, a cat is kind of natures platformer protagonist. Superb balance, insane jumping abilities, can wall-cling and even wall-climb, loves to explore nooks and crannies. But instead of making the game an actual platformer, instead there are a number of game-approved platforms you can jump to and from, and you look at them and press the jump button to go there. It gives the entire game a very movie-like feel where your interaction as a player feels kind of secondary, the game really could just play itself.I desperately wanted to like Stray, because it starts with an amazingly good intro, which is very cat-like, and has you do very cat things, but it just kind of crashes shortly after takeoff and never really recovers from that. The intro was pretty good, where you were a cat and had to solve things as a cat. Then you get a robot that can do everything for you as a human and the game suddenly becomes nothing to do with playing the game as a cat losing its appeal. I actually did enjoy this game, but theres maaaybeee 10 hours of content here, and thats being generous - its simply not worth the price. If you happen to read this and the game is on sale for 15 or less, then consider this review a positive one Another game where I dont understand the hype. The cat is cute and all, but that isnt enough to make a game good.Story was meh, puzzles were meh, characters were meh, and it made me nauseous a few times. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, the music stands out as being very unique, and the level design is tight and well thought out.But midway through the game I realized, this is just another YouTuber-oriented game thats meant for publicity instead of being anything truly substantial. Its a bit of a walking simulator, the puzzles are laughably easy, and the story doesnt really go anywhere in the end maybe it is due to the length of the game being quite short I took my time and it only amounted to about 6 hrs plus all the cutscenes.In short, even if you just watch your favorite streamerYouTuber play it, youll pretty much get the same experience.Im not saying this game is bad, its a short and fun experience, just dont expect anything too spectacular about it. A series of very sad things happen to a cat and then the game ends with no resolution to any of that. Almost nothing about the story beyond the first few minutes has anything to do with you being a cat - instead, the robot drone companion you find becomes the centerpiece. The cat is basically just there to get the drone from place to place and occasionally knock over a bottle. Theres even a lengthy section halfway through where the game basically turns into a third-person shooter. Massively disappointed. Not for me. I appreciate the novel concept, I think they executed it reasonably well, and the environments are cool. I just didnt find it fun. Its not very interactive besides walking around and pressing A at prompts, making the platformingnavigation very handholdy. I dont like saying that, because I know it comes off as a lazy and reductive criticism - but thats really all it feels like to me. the game just feels hollow honestly..... yes, im very happy that i can play a small adorable cat but it strikes an issue with me when the premise of you are a cat is literally all the game has. its litterally just a walking simulater with the occasional intervention by Dr. Fetch quest in a what is honestly to my opinion, a not very original skin.... this feels like a concept demo, like a look at all these things you can do in our new engine. something so perfectly and completly innofensive and bland that its enough to attract crowds, i.e the cat, but o simple that very little work is needed to actually make something better. but thats the issue!! it isnt a tech demo! its a full on game, or at least so it aledges. in short, overhyped to hell and back for being just, a game where you play as a cat, the cat has less personality then the floor, all the fun stuff like jumping around as an agile cat is a slave to the button prompt of context, so in reality, you dont even get ot play a cat, you play a walking, meowing vaximily of a cat with a rare condition that doesnt allow it to do anything unless a butten sais you can. I really, really wanted to give this game a recommend -- its beautiful, with the cyberpunk post-apocalyptic environment being very well crafted, and the whole idea of playing a game like this as a cat is just great.But thats what holds me up. Your character is a cat, but the game only halfway commits to this. Sure, you do some cat stuff, like crawling through small spaces and knocking the occasional bucket off a ledge. But most of the time, this game is just your standard actionadventure game, and the fact that you are a cat is ancillary to the game. The game admits this early on -- pairing your cat character with a robot helper which flies around, translates things into cat language, and acts as your hands to do things cats cannot do. So instead of having a game where your motivations, decisions, and goals are all what a cat would do, instead you play the game as basically a human trapped in a cats body. But it gets even worse, because while sometimes your cat character plays the game doing things only a cat could do, at other times the game seems to entirely forget that youre a cat. Why are there challenges where the cat has to sneak past robots? Its a cat, it has like 100 sneak, why am I having to play this challenge the same as EVERY other games sneak mission? I wanted this game to deliver on its promise -- I wanted to be a cat. But all this non-cat nonsense is taking away from the game, to the point where I havent been able to bring myself to finish it, even though Ive gotten pretty far in. Maybe one day Ill suck up my complaints and finish the game -- it really is beautiful, and I want to see the rest of the environments -- but as for now, I cannot in good faith recommend this to others. Very cute game but its also incredibly short. In 8 and a half hours Ive completely finished it and Im never likely to play it again, as due to the very linear story I dont see much replay value. The mechanics are wonderful but for a 22 price tag? Doesnt seem worth it for me. The game should be twice the length it is and easily could have been imo had the devs wanted to. Theres also an annoying amount of cutscenes that take control away from the player in such a short game moments that would have been served much better by letting the player keep control and react to them in real time. The ending is also very anti climatic because  even though you free the city into going outside, that was never the emotional investment for me. I wanted to see the cat return to their family and you dont... I have to ask what was the point in the whole adventure then? There very easily could have been a short epilogue level of going back through the first part of the game backwards and returning to them. Pros - Graphics- AnimationsCons- Story- Gameplay- Humor arrow to the knee lmaoooooo xD4 Hour game that 41 of people completed, according to achievement data. This game has been positive review bombed. Its a game that looks beautiful, with some okay puzzles, but the story it tries to tell feels very... cookie cutter, is the best way to say it. The concept itself is very unique, I will give it that much, but when it comes to actually fleshing out the characters and environment in an actually memorable way, it doesnt really do much to actually build any of it up beyond just giving you memories that dont explain much. The best way to describe it, is that it feels like one of those movies that you know was created only to win an award. Yeah the cat is great, but the game is horribly boring. Only thing you can do is move around and press A to auto jump. Putting aside the nonexistent gameplay, the only good thing about the game is cat. Levels are pretty but extremely linear.",

        "text": "Great game but If, like me, youre buying this having been attracted to the Online Co-Op tag be warned its not traditional co-op. If you want to play through the game with a friend youre gonna have a lot of headaches. Firstly trying to sync your worlds and secondly trying not to de-sync constantly. The games co-op is passive meaning youre meant to just briefly cross into other peoples game space and help out a bit and then truck off again. If youre trying to play with a friend persistently, while its possible, its like the game is constantly trying to separate you and regularly will. Ive read the co-op is more stable for some than others but for me it was extremely frustrating turning around every 5 minutes and going oh, my friend is now an AI character again, fantastic.I get the feeling if theyd just made it traditional co-op this game wouldve been received a lot better and been a lot more popular. Its clearly doable so why theyve chosen not to support it is baffling. Hey there!This game is pretty alright. Wait for a sale, this game is worth 25, not the full price of 50dlc included.--- Pros-Dynamic Exploration If you see it, and it looks reasonable, you can probably get to it. Jumping around and climbing the terrain to try and see if we could get to a place that looked out of reach was one of my buddy and Is favorite parts of the game. Very often we climb to places we think werent intended to get to, and find an item waiting for us to grab. Although, the items will come up later.Fluid Combat Games combat is very fast paced and skill based. With proper skill, you can control most combats, with difficult boss fights challenging your memory, and reactions. You are constantly being given new enemy types to play around.Atmosphere Every new area you go through is a varied landscape posing new challenges and visual aspects with an accompanying soundtrack that work very well to set the tone the designers were going for. Dungeons at first feel stifling, confined, and horrifyingly dark while you are still weak. However, they feel oppressive, magnificent, and corrupted while you are strong.Graphics The way this game was graphically designed is breathtaking, The lighting is great in this game, from when youre in small confined spaces, your light properly shines, reflecting off of walls and other surfaces really well, while massive caverns almost and sometimes literally! seem to supress the light your tiny lantern makes. The Artstyle is very simplistic, but the things that need to be detailed are. Youre faceless, because you were a blank slate. Gefn, however, is highly detailed, being a goddess of sorts.Staying Together While out adventuring, you will stay with your friend as long as both of you remain alive, and do not return to Vagrants rest. Vagrants rest, the hub town, is the only place where you can not be with another player, otherwise the entire world is travelable together. You will even stay together after defeating bosses, if you so wish. ---NeutralsStory The story, while having some interesting moments like meeting Gefn for the first time, or certain other suprising moments, was ultimately very bland, and not surprising. A Heroes Journey is what this story is, and it doesnt stray from that path.Animations Theyre okay, not the worst Ive seen. Definetly not the best.Controls While the controls reward you if you use precise movements and attacks, it is easy to overexert yourself by Action Queueing by inaccurate, or overusage of the various controls.Challenge The Game is difficult, but fair. Satisfying in difficulty, but not brutal. Died more times to gravity and drowning than enemies thrown at us. Only died about 30 times split between us, with more than half of those being accidental deaths due to falling. Some bosses were challenging, but only two required more than 2 tries to finish off.----Customization Full section of each aspect of customization here-ArmorShields This is a Negative because there are only a small amount of armor and shields in the game, 12 ArmorsShields in the base game with the DLC bringing 5 gimmick armors, and 2 shields. This is only made worse by the fact that Armors and Shields have direct upgrades. There are no reasons to use some armorshields over other ones, at all. Light Armors are all outshined by a certain set, and same said about heavy armors. However, if you just ignore the bonuses from the armors, and focus on fashion the stuff is pretty varied. My favorite was the heavy armor set Tyrants Plating which is straight up worse than Celestial Aegis. Matched well with Gefns Blessing, and it allowed me my facial hair. The Defilers Veil, the Light Armor, is straight up better than every other light armor in the game. It also matches well with the Guardians Pact.Weapons Weapons have 2 different styles, 1handed or 2handed, and 2 different types, blunt or sharp. Blunt weapons focus on stuns and higher base damage, while sharp weapons have critical hit and base damage that lowers the higher the crit is. Each weapon type bluntsharp1hand2hand only has 4 different movesets to choose from. If you find a moveset you like, youre likely to find a weapon with some variation of weapon types listed above at some point. There are enough weapon variations to make a varied build. RelicsTalismans Objects you find progressing through the story or defeating bosses that give you various buffs, like the ability of everytime you make a charge attack, a successful hit resaults in an AoE burst that does 10 more damage, and stuns 200 harder. Talismans are runes you can inscribe onto the relics that give you various buffs. Anywhere from Increasing in damage as you get lesser health, to subtracting 25 from armor stamina penalties. You can make some varied builds using these, but there are some talismans that are obviously better than others.---------Cons----Limited Storage There is a storage chest in the hub town. It is limited in storage space. You can not collect every item in the game, and keep them at town, even having to forgoe older equipment even if its obsolete to make room for new items and equipment. There isnt even a way to sell items to vendors so at the very least youre making money back, rather than just discarding them forever. If youre a hoarder, or a Collector, this will piss you off. -The wonderful exploration and item finding earlier becomes a negative as SOON as you have to decide if you want to pick up an item, or keep something else in your inventory, especially because most consumables only stack to 9, and thankfully the plentiful upgrade materials dont. This is my number 1 most hated thing about this game.-Multiplayer While the dropindropout online feature works properly, the game is pretty dead. I recommend playing this together with a friend as I did hopefully you get it on sale!, as the developers intended you to find random people to adventure with, while that just does not happen. -Connectivity Co-op is peer2peer. It can be good or bad, but lag can create moments where youre seeing enemies phase into and out of existance as the game tries to read where they are. Also, connecting to another person is instanced, while theres no loading screens, one or the other will be brought into the others world, which may resault in enemies respawning regularly if you have a bad connection. -Length As you may notice I have 21 hours of gameplay. This was an hour of premptively playing the game before getting my buddy to buy it, and 20 hours of co-op playthrough where we finished everything, and collected everything. We saw everything this game has to offer in 20 hours, and that included the DLC which was roughly only 2 hours long. My friend and I are Vets of similar games, so we may have finished it quicker than others, but if youre used to how these games play, youll fly through it.-Town Upgrades Scoria, the ingame money, will at a certain point, lose its value, as it is possible to buy everything in the village, which there is no reason not to buy everything, as Scoria is plentiful especially later on, and not have anything more to spend it on aside from cheap consumables which you may not even want to get due to the limited storage mentioned earlier.--------If you got this far, thanks for reading. Game is a good game, with severe flaws that hold it back from being a great game. I love Ashen and have played through it several times on Epic Games, hence the few hours on Steam at time of writing.Elephant in the room, Ashen seems to get bad rep for two main reasons1 It looks like Absolver, but it is nothing like Absolver. This is true, but nothing about the games promotion would lead you to think otherwise?2 It looks like Dark Souls, but it is not much like Dark Souls. For one, unlike FromSoft games, it is designed specifically so you and your friend can play through the whole thing in one go, instead of having to constantly bonfire back and forth. It 100 benefits from being played that way, as opposed to playing it on your own and bumping into people at tough spots as one might be inclined to do.This decision seems to me to compliment another essential difference in the Game of ThronesDark Souls era of grim-dark actually all options are bad, you idiot, you fucking buffoon, and being anything other than cynical makes you a moron, Ashen dares to have a heart.Think of it as if Dark Souls was inspired by Shunas Journey instead of Berserk.Understandably disappointing if you are looking for Absolvers unique fighting system or Souls series sense of oppression and desperation.Excellent, one of a kind game if youre looking to share a wondrous journey with a friend or significant other. Theres nothing else quite like it out there, save maybe Outward, and what it strikes out to do it does wonderfully. Its like if Dark Souls went to rehab, cleaned up, got back on its anti-depressants and started rebuilding its relationships with its family. It followed its passion, built a career from scratch, had a few kids, moved to Wyoming, started a ranch and forged a legacy thatll last a thousand years. Plus it started powerlifting, got absolutely yoked and started wearing Tom Ford all the time for some reason.Its really, really good. It got lambasted by a bunch of SoulsBorne YouTubers as just a storebrand FromSoft game but it really isnt. It really is like a lovechild of Bloodborne and Journey. The music will make you cry, the landscapes will have you staring in awe and the caves will have you punching your thigh until you tear a ligament. 1010. This game deserves way more love!I hardly ever see anyone talking about it, and I really dont know why its so under the radar...It has almost everything I seek in a Souls-like- Very good combat and animations- Incredible athmosfere- A lot of exploration.I must say this review will seem quite negative, but thats simply because I tend to remember things I dislike way more than things I like in pretty much everything I consume. But that doesnt necessarily mean my overall opinion is bad... Anyway, lets beginThe controlls all feel very familiar if you are a souls fan, and the combat is also very similar.Its all about learning the time to dodge, to hit, learning the attack pattern of the enemies, and learning the best ways to use the moveset of your weapon.I also like how the weapons got balanced. Those with higher damage will mostly have low critical chance or either a worse moveset, those with a better moveset will either lack raw damage or critical chance and so on. So there are options for all playstyles and there are very few objectively bad weapons.The art in the game is simply beautiful and the atmosphere makes every area feel unique and give you a different feeling. Caves and dungeons get really dark, making it mandatory to carry a properly upgraded lamp. Which you can always place on the ground, in case you want to go for two-handed weapons in such places.I also like how the areas are quite big and open, so theres plenty of room to explore and find secret items hidden in every corner. Sometimes you can even find hidden paths, but they are not always rewarding.There are some interesting details like the ost played in the main town changing slightly as you progress through the game. The way as the town grows as you progress, and how the NPCs seem to gain better gear also makes you feel like you are making some actual difference in that world.It has a quite interesting lore too, if you dig into it, but its easily misseable. I may look more into it later...-----------------------------------But of course, the game is not perfect. And has a few problemsFirst the progression is a bit awkward you spend the entire game saving Scoria and feeling like you never have enought to upgrade all the things you need. Until you get to the last two regions and suddenly gets overwhelmed with tons of it, so you get very excited to go back to the main town to do some real progress with your gear... Just to realize you was in the very final upgrade of pretty much everything, and no longer have anything actually important to use the whole bunch of Scoria you have left...The bosses were a bit disapointing for me with a few exceptions.Most of them just feel like regular enemies, but with a huge health bar...They often have one unique mechanic in the fight, but its never a big deal, and they have mostly generic movesets that willl hardly ever change during the fight. So they are fairly easy, to the point that theres only one boss in the entire game that I didnt kill in the first try... without counting the DLC, since I didnt play it yetI also must say that I really dislike how Ashen deals with enemies respawns. It being by time instead of interacting with a checkpoint completely takes away the feeling of walking freely by a clean area. And its even worse in closed dungeons. Meeting enemies you already killed when you walk backwards in a closed dungeon makes no sense at all!Another issue is the multiplayer, which is pretty much dead if you dont call a friend to play with you. And even if you bring one, its fairly easy to lose the possibility to connect in case you do a main objective before your friend. And if you are alone you are left with the AI companion, which seems to alternate between two states of mind The decent helper and the complete nuts. When in the second state, the AI will just do some nonsense like jump off the nearest cliff, become irresponsive at a random spot until you force it to respawn, get confused hitting the air while trying to save you from a grab attack, etc...----And besides all that, the game could really use some quality of life changes such as- Unlimited storage space honestly, you cant even store all the different weapons and armour in the storage...- Unrestricted inventory slots. I mean, why do I need to have a permanent empty slot just because I dont want to use potions? Why cant I just place any other consumable there? Or why cant I just have another one handed weapon equipped instead of my two handed?- A better keybinding for the lances having the same key as regular weapon swapping is just annoying, and creates bad situations when you need to swap between 1h and 2h quickly- Less multiplayer restrictions- And maybe the possibility to place markers in the map, so you dont have to remember everything by head when you backtrack...So, my final grade8.510 in coop710 with AIProbably the best souls-like Ive played in a long time, but could be even better! I have a pretty hard time trying to recommend this game. On one hand, this is probably one of if not the most beautiful games I have ever played. On an artistic level, this game has nailed almost everything. I want to explore this world, learn all of its lore. The music is perfect for establishing the feelings of loneliness and emptiness that plagues the world. The lone warriors trying to rekindle the light on their planet. The story is amazing as well. Every character you recruit has a great arc where you learn about them, their past, their people and their goals. Their quests are great and complex and have a lot of intrigue.Gameplay is where things become a little rough. It doesnt really do anything special as a souls like. You have 3 types of weapons. One handed weapons, two handed, and spears. The main one handed two handed weapons are separated by a few subtypes where their stats are weighted differently on each weapon. One weapon will have a really high crit rate, but low base attack and stun etc. There is no progression with your weapons aside from when you gain the ability to upgrade them later. So the big axe you picked up at the start of the game will never have to be replaced if you keep up with its upgrade requirements. The weapons are honestly boring. You use what you personally find is most effective to go through the game and thats it. The game needed a more interesting progression system because as it is now, its very flat. Nothing changes about your weapons besides the stats and a small glow it gets near its max level. Weapons also dont really have any interesting animations or anything, it just is. Bosses in this game leave a lot to be desired. Because the combat system in this game is quite flat, I assumed they couldnt do much with the boss design. They were all exciting and interesting bosses but gameplay wise, it didnt take much for me to beat them. The only boss I have a problem with is Sissna. The first phase of the boss is beyond flat and takes too long because of her large health pool and her constant, and I mean CONSTANT dodging. Enemies in this game have Iframes as well! Normal enemies were honestly great. Near the end of the game, a lot more variety was honestly desired, but the challenge of the environment you were in, paired up with the enemies never made them boring. The enemies are honestly extremely challenging. Even at the base game youll find 70 of your health getting chunked by some common enemies, and a lot of them fight like players as well, to the point where it becomes pretty cinematic experience where youre both exchanging dodges and blows against each other.The Rune system needed so much more. All the runes are boring and flat. Even the main tree ones that give you decent combat benefits are just standard talents in other games. Theyre all almost boring stat increases and I wish it was better.The final thing of note is that this game commits the unforgivable sin of dogshit AI. The game can be played co-op with a friend Im waiting to try that with a friend of mine. The game is meant to be played with two regardless, and your companion constantly drowns, gets stuck and acts like a fucking idiot. This will infuriate you honestly. You can disable the partner AI, but the game is designed to be played with this second person. Their stun chance and agroo soak is essential honestly to playing the game, otherwise youll be playing the game in an extremely slow manner. The solution I can think of is you absorb a portion of your partners stats if you disable them from the menu, thus making the game a little more balanced towards pure solo play.If for some reason youre still reading this review and still stuck in between. I recommend you buy this game at the end. Go being prepared for some of its flaws, and get ready to enjoy some of the best story, world design, zones, mobs and enemies youll have the pleasure of playing. I only wish it had more to it. I hope it gets a bomb sequel where it addresses these issues I think the biggest reason for Ashen not recieving a very positive rating is that people tend to lament over the things the game doesnt offer instead of appreciating what it does.In my opinion the game offers alot which other souls-like dont, most obvious example would be the jumping and climbing mechanics enabling a parkour like exploration at times.If you see something that looks climbable it most of the time is in one way or another and usually will also have a reward waiting for you aswell.Other than that the game is designed to be played in co-op, while the AI Companions do offer some help in the base game and playing it solo is also viable, dungeon doors and some climbing spots are literally designed for 2 players.The co-op is also pretty good with you being able to connect to your friends with a multiplayer filter and being able to explore the whole map together except for Vagrants Rest, which is kind of like a ever changing Firelink Shrine.Playing through Children of Sissna would also have taken alot more time with AI or solo, rather than with my friend.The only real negative aspect to multiplayer is the fact that your friend will not show up as himself but rather as one of the NPC companions, depending on which quest you have activeThe Combat is pretty much what youd expect, a stamina bar which depletes on attacks, dodges and blocksThere is a slight difference in the dodging mechanic, if you press dodge once you do a bloodborne inspired dash but if you press dodge twice you will actually roll instead of dashing.The weapons boil down to axe and club variants, which are then seperated into one- or two-handed.Axe weapons usually have lower base damage but faster swinging speed and crit chance compared to clubs which swing slower, have no crit chance but offer higher stun and damage.The stundamage is used to break guards or stagger enemies, while Blunt weapons excel at this, its also possible to pair a shield with a one-handed axe and use the shield to break guards or interrupt.Each weapon has a very unique look to it and upgrading them makes different parts of the weapon glow.Shields and Armor sadly cant be upgraded at all but better lanterns can be bought later on in the game.Story and artstyle are definetly a matter of taste but in my opinion neither of it was bad, story had some decent twists and you can get into it if you really care and as for the artstyle I just really liked it.The different Areas are all unique and look beautifully crafted and so are the dungeons.I had a great time with the game and would definetly recommend it to anyone whos looking for a souls-like game to enjoy with a friendBUT I would also recommend you to wait for it to go on sale, as the full price can seem a bit high In short Ashen is a game that doesnt feel complete, it feels like Im waiting for the full release of the game. Even though I said this I would still recommend the game if it is on sale and you enjoy souls-like games. In long Ashen breaks my heart. The game has so many great ideas and cool moments, like meeting Gefn for the first time, or seeing the diasora, or the town building mechanic, but other parts of the game feel incomplete. When I say that I mean when you explore the world, which looks good and is thematically interesting,  you only find crafting materials, ashen feathers, or weapons and armor. There arent many secrets, or interesting items, or characters. There are only 11 npcs in ashen and 2 of them can only be found in the DLC. Of the 9 npcs in the base game 7 can give you main or side quests and the other two are just characters that you interact with to complete quests. All of the npcs have little depth, and have little backstory. Since the game is intended to be a souls-like it seems it was intended for the characters to have so little depth so they appear mysterious, but it only makes the game feel incomplete. Also, a lot of weapons and enemies have the same move set, and the combat is very bare bones which contributes to the feeling of the game being incomplete. But nothing contributes to the feeling of incompleteness when playing ashen as much as bosses reappearing as basic enemies. Like the bosses were originally intended to be just enemies and are just placeholder bosses. Its also strange that while the game feels unfinished the released DLC that feels like it should be in the base game, but was just detached from the world and turned into DLC. This review is mostly negative, so you might be confused as to why I still recommended this game, and its mostly because I love souls-like games, and even though the game doesnt feel finished the few highlights kept me playing like some of the later bosses being really good. I would still only buy this game if it was on discount and you enjoy souls-like games. I felt like I needed to wait to write this review because of the fact that so many reviews were just incorrect in their idea of what this game really is. Fair warning, Im not going to do a TLDR because if you really want a clear understanding of what this game is you cant get it from like 6 words, but I will split this into 3 parts, and I will also preface this by saying Ive been following Ashen since its announcement and even waited for the year-release on steam, oh, and Im not disappointed  .Part 1 - MisconceptionsI need to get this part out of the way first. This game is not Dark Souls, it barely has any similarities other than you die. If youve ever played Absolver, then this game instantly looks familiar to you. If not, go check it out, its a really fascinating experience. I played Absolver and after almost completing the story of this game I have to say that these two games are like brothers from a different mother. They have the exact same feel with the same art style, and so if you dont like Absolver or didnt like it then dont play this game. The combat isnt similar either, and if we want to compare this game to any its more like Skyrim than it is Dark Souls, so dont cry about it lacking certain things when that isnt the artistic intent.Part 2 - StoryWorld-BuildingIn my opinion this games story is very interesting. By the end I felt very invested in the characters and even sad that some of the side-stories ended. The ambient sound in this game is incredible and really adds to the feel. I even found myself prioritizing other NPCs over others from their personalities and combat style. The voice acting is a little strange at first, but I think its the accents, once you get used to it everything settles into place. One of my favorite things in this game is the world-building, specifically at Vagrants Rest The Home Base. Your little place starts out as nothing but some rocks, but over the course of the game you go back and theres development. The characters you know and love have built more things and even landscaped a bit, I felt extremely satisfied coming back after a long trek to a completely new home base. All of the areas of the game feel different and interesting, the enemies and challenging, but have their weaknesses. Another extremely cool thing I found in this game is the fact that bosses are nothing like Dark Souls other than the fact that they have health bars. All major bosses are actually started with a dungeon, and once you beat the dungeon you fight the boss. At first I thought this was frustrating, but after dying a bunch cause Im an idiot and also cause Jokell is a bitch- I mean very nice guy- I would beat the dungeon and feel even more dopamine than in Dark Souls, the battles felt more meaningful and werent just throwaway fights like some in the Dark Souls franchise cough cough Crystal Sage. The exploration was very rewarding, with every twist and turn leading to new rewards, all-be-it some worse than others, but overall very satisfying.Part 3 - GearCharacter CustomizationNow this part got me a bit annoyed when reading other reviews, comparing this game to Dark Souls or Skyrim, yes, it is lacking in armor or weapons, BUT if you compare it to Absolver, then youll feel very satisfied with the gear. All throughout the game you get new weapons, all of which are actually viable in the long term and I even use one of the first one-handed axes even in the late game. Even if there are 2 similar weapons, they most likely have different move sets. The armor looks pretty cool and like the weapons all the armor can be used late game. There are some armors that arent as good at what they do, but they all have their bonuses. One thing I think a lot of people dont put much attention on is the Runes. The Runes really let you hone your play-style and put your fighting into a different category. All of the Runes have their own benefits and this really leads to different combination. So much so that IMO it makes up for not leveling up your character. The game was extremely fun combat wise and I always felt that when I died it was because of 2 things 1. I got too reckless, and 2. Jokell is a fucking bitch. Overall the combat is very satisfying and feels great when executed nicely. Another thing that ties into this is that the bosses arent supposed to be these impossible fortresses, theyre at the end of their respective dungeons and are are still pretty difficult, but most of the reason youll be depressed over your loss of in-game currency is from the fact that you made a mistake and you probably shouldnt have let Jokell come with you.-Conclusion-Overall the game is a 9.710. I really enjoyed this game, Its overall feel and world-building were impressive and the enemies were very interesting and cool, except for the Rhino things, dont feel bad for them, they may be the slowest thing in the entire game, but they pretty much one-shot, so dont get cocky. I bought this game with the DLC and have been waiting to finish the game to play it, so Ill comment on this review when I finish it. The game is nicely challenging without making you rage, the stories are satisfying, and the world exploration is fun. I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone that likes world exploration and thinks the art-style looks slick.BONUS!!!!!  Hoppers Tips and Tricks -- If you hear a dripping noise, its a spider, I almost died from a heart attack multiple times.- To switch who your partner is, change your selected quest, and whoever the person the story is for youll get them.- DO NOT LOOK UP ANYTHING ON THIS GAMES PROGRESSION! If you feel lost, just continue with the story and Itll make sense, this includes exploration and other things related to that.- There is Fast-Travel, its a little later on, so before you get it, stock up on those bone-piles that teleport you back to Vagrants Rest.- In Multiplayer, your NPC will become possessed by the other player, this doesnt really matter seeing as the game is a story-driven game and it might ruin your immersion if some weirdo shows up dressed like its Halloween, If you dont want players joining your game and spam-pinging you to walk the opposite of where youre going, turn off Multiplayer in the settings Thats what I did, screw you random guy trying to waste my time.- Be patient, dont throw a fit if you die, it happens. If you feel under-powered, go finish some side-stories and come back.Thank you for reading this far into my review! I never really write reviews, but the ones already put on this game feel lacking. Ill have comments enabled and try to be as active as a can, if you have any questions feel free to ask. And if you enjoyed this game, I highly recommend Absolver, its another beautiful title by similar in style to Ashen. And with this I bid adieu, have a great experience out there! Im going to say this is a cautious recommendation. There are interesting areas and enemies to encounter and some elements are quite unique, however I was left slightly underwhelmed.The most immediate issue I have with the game is tied to the art direction. All the characters look like Playmobil characters I assume this was to save on asset development and polygon count however the result is disconcerting. In stark contrast to the characters a lot of the enemies and creatures look very nice, so I cant help but wish they had found a middle ground with the character models themselves. The second most outstanding issue is tied to multiplayer. For context, I enjoy playing through action RPGs in multiplayer with friends if available, I usually play in multiplayer. It is possible to play through this game in co-op by setting a multiplayer password, but instead of directly joining the game uses a sort of matchmaking system based on player proximity and world state. This means it is possible to end up in a situation where the game refuses to sync you to your friend until certain requirements are met and you spend a lot of time going are you doing X right now to figure out whether your friend is in your game or your AI companion is just exhibiting strange behavior. This is exacerbated by the fact that your AI companionco-op partner takes the appearance of the character whose quest you are undertaking at the time, meaning you will never see what your friend is wearing or what their character looks like. This, combined with the ability for characters to boost onto ledges and open dungeon doors only if their companion is present, leads to an odd dissonance where for most of the game it appears to have been designed for a single player, yet sometimes appears to strongly incentivize cooperative play. Its very strange and combined with the matchmaking I described earlier, caused a great amount of frustration.If youre still game to play, the game does feature some very interesting environments and has some fairly unique mechanics preparation is heavily incentivized with potion crafting, consumable hoarding and spear crafting being key to progress. Having the correct items on hand can trivialize encounters. You unlock fast travel about halfway through the game and combined with spear throwing, teleportation and lanterns used for visibility makes for pretty satisfying exploration while still allowing you to properly return to base and prepare. Each character has their own questline as well, and completing them gives resources, health, stamina, or access to additional upgrades.The DLC is worth getting as its a large unique dungeon with new enemies and a decent boss. The soundtrack was functional, but it didnt stand out to me one way or the other. There is only one ending, but completion on the games hard mode unlocked midway through the game and DLC is required for 100 achievements. Finally, I found the story, final boss and ending underwhelming. The story and ending needed a little less ambiguity in my opinion, and with only a couple standout mechanics present in the game I have difficulty mustering enthusiasm for a second playthrough. The game functions well and is enjoyable I feel comfortable recommending it to the average player, but its missing something. --- Graphics --- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it MS-DOS--- Gameplay --- Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Watch paint dry instead Just dont--- Audio --- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Im now deaf--- Audience --- Kids Teens Adults Grandma--- PC Requirements --- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer--- Difficulty --- Just press W Easy Easy to learn  Hard to master Significant brain usage Difficult Dark Souls--- Grind --- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboardsranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding--- Story --- No Story Some lore Average Good Lovely Itll replace your life--- Game Time --- Long enough for a cup of coffee Short Average Long To infinity and beyond--- Price --- Its free!

Its unique art style and gameplay mechanic succeed in arousing my interest. I play through the game and I get plenty to say about the game. Commonly referred as soul-like game, bearing some resemblances from the Dark Souls series, Ashen gets some tricks up its sleeve fresh enough to differentiate itself from the category. Things I like about Ashen  1. Great Atmosphere Traditional duality of light and dark is one of the main themes of Ashen. The dev does a great job in portraiting the two themes. At first the world is shrouded in darkness. Everything looks sombre and cold, yet somehow calm. When the Ashen is reborn, grossly incandescent light bursts out, igniting the world like a magnificent father . Our character awakes, bathing in the warm light of Ashen. Even the world appears to be unattended and ruined, the veil of light softly, gently envelops our surroundings. Tranquility is the best word to describe the tone. It feels like no matter where you go, theres  always people around to give you company. This part of the game has already given me a fresh start because most of the souls-like games used to deliver their opening sequence with a sense of dread as if the world is dying. About darkness, when you explore the first dungeon, the gloom emanates from the door. In contrast to the warmth of light, the darkness embraces you with coldness. However, the cold here is not something you experience physically, rather mentally. The feeling is the same as staying alone in the darkness, the tone of solitary. Its somehow peaceful and makes the exploration quite chilling or dare I say easy. These two examples are the best way to showcase how great the dev build the world and levels with light and dark. Just like the NPC says in the gameIts great to be alone in the dark, but in the light, we often crave for companion. 2. Good Reward for Progression There are two parts of the game you can notice this idea. First one is Vagrants Rest. As you venture out the world, our little sanctuary does not cease to develop itself since we liberate the place. Once you finish the dungeon, tired and running out of resources, from time to time you can travel back to Vagrants Rest to restock and be amazed at how the place has changed over time, from basic structures to an actually populated village. Near the end the village is complete. Everyone you meet along the road all settles in their special cottage, and our character of course, gets a house with a comforting bed and a treasure chest in it. At that point we are no longer wanderers without a place to call home, Vagrants Rest has already become our home, a home where we truly belong. The second one is about individual NPC. At the end of their responding quests, each NPC will give you either stamina or health increase, and as the final quest complete, NPC will receive a different outfit. The rewards make these side quests mandatory to complete since the other way to upgrade yourself is to find the Ashen feathers scattering around the world. The outfits might not be as rewarding as others consider, but for me it is a token of proof, proof that I have journeyed with them and assist them whenever I can. 3. A Straight-forward story Decrypting the whole lore of Dark Souls series sure is fascinating, but sometimes a visible, coherent story line is not a bad thing at all. 4. Bataran, can I marry your sister Silaren pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase?   Things I dislike about Ashen  1. The AI Is Really Dumb Dont know why but especially JokellThere are so many dumb things my NPC companion had committed throughout my playthrough. The two most frequent incidents are as below charging off a cliff, and enjoying floating in water. The first one goes like this when an enemy is near a cliff, a single swing is enough to push it down to its demise. NPC approaches with hisher axe, ready to end its whole career. Heshe charges up a full heavy attack and both of them go down the cliffvisible confusion and utter disappointment. I dont know if its intentionally designed or not, but NPC seems to always open a fight with a fully-charged heavy attack no matter the circumstance is. The second one is semi my fault actually. I fail to jump over the river. NPC jumps in the water with me. I can quickly swim to the shore without running out of my stamina. When I look back, my companion is still in water. Heshe does not even move an inch. We then proceed to have seconds of staring contest and heshe finally drownsanother speechless moment. As a result, equipping the Fury tailsmanif your companion dies, you gain 25 damage, maxing out at 50 damage, until you rest at a Ritual Stone is a must thanks to these two incidents. 2. Unsatisfying Upgrade Usually in other action adventure games when you feel like certain enemy is really hard to kill, its either you are poorly-armed or your level is too low. Farm some experience and upgrade material at previous level will resolve the problem. In terms of Ashen regarding the same situation, you are definitely ill-equipped since there is no character level system. However, even if you upgrade to a better or suitable level, you still hit like a wet noodle. From my experience, I upgrade the Toothed Club to ashen infused 6, in the Lathyrus Palace dungeon the enemies take four to five hit to finish. I then gather some materials and scoria to max out my weapon. I return and finish the same enemy with four to five hit. Hmmmm. I dont really expect a fully-upgraded to suddenly one-shot everything, but whats the point of upgrading 6 to 7 since you deal visually the same amount damage? 3. You Cannot Pet The Diasora Cub in Ashen  4. Two-handed Weapons Are Not Viable in Dungeons Dungeons of Ashen are typically dark. Without a lantern you can hardly navigate, let along knowing what lurks in the dark. Hence, the situation only favors lantern in left hand, light weapon in right hand. Even though the game gives you a tip indicating that you can drop the lantern and it will automatically return to your hand. This may sound like a way to use two-handed weapon. In reality it is not. Your vision in the dark is limited, you are forced to move around your lantern, and you cannot chase the enemy unless you go back and pick up the lantern. All of this can be skipped if you just use a light weapon instead. Some may say that NPC carry a lantern as well. Why not let them do the lighting? Well, to answer this question please refer to my first dislike.Flawed it might be, Ashen is still a good adventure game to play through it yourself. This is a tricky one. Many aspects of this game are absolutely amazing, but there are certain things that drag it down a peg.Ill start with the good stuffVisually this game is amazing. probably my favourite visual style I have ever seen. Its consistent, yet still varied, beautiful yet haunting, and there are moments that made my jaw drop and I just sat in awe.The soundtrack is also one of the best I have heard. It steers away from the usual european orchestral sound and nails it, creating a truly unique, haunting and beautiful sound, that perfectly emphasises important moments and adds a subtle drum track when you enter combat, in a way that feels perfectly natural.Combat generally feels good, but is dragged down by the AI companion which Ill get to.And the few bosses there are, feel good, but not exceptional. There is a wide array of weapons, even if none feel drastically different from the rest.Now to the bad stuffThe AI companion is a questionable decision. At the best of times its a nice helping hand, but most of the time is just a distraction that lessens the flow of combat. It can be turned off, but there are certain ledges you cant climb and certain doors you cant open without the AI companion, and since the game is balanced around the companion being there, turning it off is not really a viable way to play for most people on their first playthrough.There are also way too few bosses, and about half of the few there are, are just beefed up versions of standard enemies. Two of them are genuinely good, even if one of them is made a little worse by spawning in little minions in the second phase. Enemy variety is also bad, with most enemy movesets being reused for most areas. Weapon variety is also not that great, while they do feel pretty good, every weapon is just a variation of hammer or axe, two handed or one handed.The game is also too long. It adds an extra area at the end. right after one of the best areas in the game that felt like it led up to the a climactic end, the game just keeps going, adding an annoying swamp area that halts the pace right before the end.TLDRThe game is good. Really good. Even if its only true strengths lie in its presentation, with the gameplay leaving a bit to be desired, it manages to a successful and unique take on the soulslike genre. Overall this game has been a pleasure to play and I am only stopping to post this review because I think it has been judged unfairly so far.Ashen scratches all the right itches of a Souls game while innovating in a few key areas. The movement is a bit more free-form and fluid than Souls games. You have a dedicated jump button and there are ledge grabs that make jumps easier. At first it was a bit difficult to tell which ledges you could grab onto and which ones would lead you sliding, but after about an hour or so you get the idea.Quest-wise, I much prefer Ashens straightforward approach. Where the Souls games would involve you in side-quests that, in some cases, left you even wondering what the hell you were supposed to do, Ashen implements a more typical RPG-style approach with quest markers. Many of them only lead you into the general area, however, so exploration is somewhat preserved. Still, I recognize that many people will see this as a negative I didnt.My favorite innovation that Ashen focuses on is its exploration. Along with the typical open-world style of game where you are running between bonfires shrines in Ashen there are periods where you find yourself crawling through pitch-black dungeons with only a lantern and your one-handed weapon. These moments are tense the first time you go through them as enemies can pop out from around corners or a skeleton might animate. However, just like the Souls games, once you know what to expect after dying, in most cases you can move through these dungeons much more quickly. Its an extremely satisfying gameplay loop.In terms of character progression, Ashen does away with stat-based progression. Simply put, the more side-quests you do, the more health and stamina you will have. As you progress through individual companions storylines, you will be rewarded with HP and Stamina increases. There are gear pick-ups and you can change weapons and armor, but for the most part, so far, it has simply been a system of incremental upgrades. On top of this, theres a fun rune-type system where you can specialize your character for instance one rune might increase the damage you deal to enemies until you get hit, while another causes you to slowly sprout wings which will eventually reflect damage back to your attackers.Weapon types are far less varied than the Souls games. You have One-handers, Two-handers, and Spears as a projectile weapon. The melee weapons come in two basic flavors blunt weapons typically maces have a higher chance to stun enemies, while edged weapons typically axes have a chance to crit and deal extra damage. I havent noticed a huge variety in movesets, but there is definitely some. Many people enjoy the Souls games because of the deep character customization with dozens of different weapons that rely on different stats and movesets there is much less of that in Ashen. In terms of story, characters, and world-building, I actually prefer Ashens style to the Souls games. My biggest gripe with the Souls series was that the story and the world is not something the typical player can uncover for themselves everyone I know that has wanted to delve into the Souls world has had to rely on wikis, youtubers and other external resources. I hate that. In Ashen, I have never once needed to alt-tab to get more info on a character or felt that I would be missing some secret dialogue or even a quest. Things arent exactly straightforward there is still a lot of room for interpretation in the overall mythos of the world, but its not so esoteric as to make me roll my eyes and alt-tab.To conclude this long-winded review I think that I would say Ashen is one of the most approachable games I have played in the Souls-like genre, though it doesnt compromise on difficulty. I think the pricepoint is perfect  you get most of the meat of the Souls-like gameplay, but without all of the complicated systems that require external resources to unpack and understand. This game falls into the Souls-Like genre, but its not Dark Souls clone. It has its own unique style, interesting atmosphere and lore. The combat is not overly complicated, but its not one dimensional. This game is well worth one play through. If you are looking for a game with deep mechanics and exhilirating boss fights, like sekiro or bloodborne, do not buy this game. But if you are looking for a game with some of the best ambiance, beautiful visuals and a unique artstyle, then you have found what you are looking for. Also, its kind of like mini elden ring in some ways.

The models and terrains still look good to me.There are only single or double handed clubs or axes to use as your main weapon, but you do get shields, spears and shields as utility items too. The AI is actually quite useful and you will rely on them in a few fights. I had a few real people jump in for co-op, but this wasnt very common.The enemies are actually varied enough throughout the course of the game and the setting changes enough to keep your interest. The story is pretty forgettable, but the rebuilding of your main village is an attractive reason to keep plodding along.It isnt the hardest Soulslike Ive played, but is still a challenge. I do think they got carried away with the last boss though, as I nearly rage quit the game before looking up a few hints. Ive waited an entire year for this to be on steam, thanks to Epic exclusivity. And Im not disappointed in the slightest. The wait was worth it.Its rare I get into a game and feel stunned by the beauty of the surrounding scenery. The difficulty isnt so hard as to make you cry what bullshit, but every time I got beaten by something, I knew it was because I had made a mistake and that it wasnt the games fault. The random seamless co-op really surprised me too, one minute I was wandering about and the next minute I see a person whos beating up enemies, only to team up with him and run through several objectives together.I think I only have two problems with the game. Firstly, the customisation, while interesting, seems limited in comparison to other games similar this Dark Souls, Code Vein and such, but thats honestly pretty minor. The major problem I have with it is that you cant see the customisations of anyone who joins you. All companions who join through the seamless co-op function, whether AI or human, seem to look the same, other than carrying different weapons. I dont quite understand it and, especially when I first started, made me feel confused about if it was a player or an AI who had joined me.Overall, though, its a really pleasant experience so far, and Im glad I got this game. Wonderful environments, minimal stories, great character design. I would define Ashen as a  softlike , because compared to soulslikes its quite easy and it also lacks the complexity of combat, stats and enemies. Still, the game works perfectly fine and difficulty is always well balanced, except maybe for a few moments where the path to the boss is harder than the boss itself. Since the moveset is limited and there are not many types of weapons you will mostly dodge and attack for the whole time. Shields are not so effective in this game and they will just consume the stamina you need for dodging when attacked from multiple sides. As always, learning the enemy pattern is the key to the victory., but most of the normal enemies use the same pattern with some little variation and things only get interesting during mini and regular boss fights. During your quests you always have a following NPC which most of the time is useful especially for climbing high walls, but can also be annoying when he gets stuck and cant reach you, or when he dies by falling off a cliff. If you activate the online multiplayer a real player can join and play as your NPC, which is much better, but it rarely happens cause the multiplayer is kinda broken. You can also play co-op with a friend if you set a filter code, that should work better.The atmosphere is really great. The exploration feels rewarding, especially at the beginning when you are weak and only have a few items. You can increase your stats by completing sidemain quests and finding the hidden black and white feathers of the Ashen. Side quests are great and involve different characters and places you wouldnt normally explore during your main quest. Unfortunately the exploration ends up being useless soon after you max everything you can. There are some secret armors and weapons hidden, but most of the time you will be overwhelmed with crafting materials you wont need anymore.Now some negative points- You can only upgrade weapons no armors, no shields.- Limited storage space that cant even contain all the weapons  shields  armors you will find.- Enemies respawn after some time and can be really annoying before unlocking fast travel.- Some parts can be easily cheated by simply rushing to the nearest ritual stone.- You cant skip the ending credits.The game is well worth if you are looking for a simple soulslike with a beautiful open world and an interesting lore. The base price is a bit high though, I would recommend it only on sale.PS If you want to take screenshots without the HUD I suggest downloading the Ashen Hud Toggle mod by Pino44io.",
        "summary": "If you want to play through the game with a friend youre gonna have a lot of headaches. The games co-op is passive meaning youre meant to just briefly cross into other peoples game space and help out a bit and then truck off again. While its possible, its like the game is constantly trying to separate you and regularly will."

        "text": "Tldr after finishing the game and the DLC, including the Children of Sissna mode. Steam really needs a yellow sideways thumb, but since there isnt one, this goes into the not recommended bargain bin if you want to check it when its on sale. Greatly unepic after shedding the mantle of Epic exclusivity. It earns enormous merits in art, visuals, sound direction and world building. But its marred by iffy, erratic and sluggish combat, janky hitboxes, mostly terrible AI companions, unrewarding exploration and levelling, overabundance of weapons that dont make much difference, an atrocious final boss and something called the Children of Sissna mode, which is anything but a fair game. It boggles me that anyone thought that would make for a fun experience. And all of this, somewhat miraculously, still makes it an okish game inspired by a long line of soulslikes. But not a great recommendation.And now, a slightly longer thought pattern. Greatly unepic after shedding the mantle of Epic exclusivity yes, Im repeating this one. Its just ok. It could be recommended just on the merits of its art, sound direction and world building, but it has gameplay issues and bad design choices that take it down a few notches. Its visually stunning, adopting a cartoonish look that still conveys all the desolation, dread and haunting atmosphere as easily as it does the warmth and colors of your slowly emerging town. The story is served to you through exposition, conversations with characters you dont much care about and in descriptions of items, like a lot of soulslikes, meaning it has the same storytelling flaws that come with that. Ashen at least has a more positive outlook overall.The game in general seems to be easier and much more gentler, if I can call it that, than its inspirations. You still lose your souls, or scoria in this case, when you die and have to backtrack to get it but I found myself not caring that much because it was oftentimes easier to farm it if needed then go back and get the lost ones. There are two ways to level up your character. By doing quests, story and sidequests, that grant larger permanent bonuses and by finding large feathers that grant very slight permanent bonuses. None of that requires scoria. Scoria is used for upgrading your weapon, your gourd healing flask, buying items and potions and equipping talismans and relics which require you to pay for them when you equip them and any time you want to exchange them for another talisman or relic. There are 4 talisman slots and 1 relic slot. Your town grows organically as the game progresses, no need for investing anything, armor and shields cannot be upgraded and as I mentioned, theres no levelling by using scoria.The combat is iffy, janky and feels overly sluggish. You are easily stunnable and broken out of attacks, enemies a bit less. Their movements are erratic, its sometimes hard to judge when and where to dodge and it seems theres a slight hitbox problem. There were times when the enemies would just stop doing anything or get stuck on a slightly raised rock, and then there were times when theyd jump and attack from so far away theres no way youd expect it, there was a lot of wall and mountain phasing spears that hit me when they shouldnt have and the enemies would sometimes respawn out of nowhere. It seems they respawn even when youre in the same area based on some kind of a timer or if you move far enough from the spawn points. The two main game dungeons, which are basically long runs to the boss, feature no checkpoints until you get in front of the boss door. And theyre loooong. This becomes even more annoying in Children of Sissna mode.The shield gets a mention just for its uselessness the further you are in the game. Spears are your best friends. Seriously, anything is exploitable with spears, even the final boss. The final boss gets a special mention, without spoiling anything, because its attacks and behaviour are atrocious. You can have an AI companion it can be turned off, but its usually more trouble than its worth because theyre unpredictable, sometimes surviving great odds and even a boss almost untouched and sometimes getting stuck on rocks, falling of ledges and even worse, drawing enemies far from you because they decided to attack them. And in that iffiness, the game usually relies on throwing multiple enemies just to make it harder.I havent done much co-op, but its a weird Journey like experience, with your co-op partner taking over for your AI companion. It doesnt seem to really work well and the normal game only gets easier if you manage to grab a good partner.Theres a lot of weapons in the game, but theres not much difference between them. Slightly different movesets and a new visual are not compensation for the same weapon youve been using from the start. I finished the game by just upgrading a mace and two-handed axe that I found at the beginning. They all upgrade with the same materials. As you move through areas, the armors you find become better, if you find them. Theyre usually lying on the ground like any other loot. Theres no reason not to equip the latest one you found. The heavier ones reduce your stamina regeneration, but I havent noticed much impact in a normal game. In Children of Sissna mode, its noticeable, but considering how easy it is to die there, any armor doesnt make much of a difference.You eventually get a storage box built in town. It has limited inventory slots, but theres no need to actually keep anything apart from upgrade and potion materials.A few words on the Children of Sissna mode. Your health and stamina are halved, feathers only give 1 health or stamina, upgrade rewards from quests are scaled down completely and you die very, very easily. This is the mode where farming for scoria makes sense, so you can buy all the stuff thatll you need to make this bearable if youre drunk enough to even give it a try. All the combat iffiness and all the bad design choices are so pronounced here, its amazing that anyone thought this through. Its passable, patience is a virtue, but its not fun. If you can get a good co-op partner for this perhaps someone with a lot of experience in soulslikes, everyone needs a soul lv1 friend this probably becomes much easier. Most normal players wont be playing this mode anyway.I know that every game cant be Dark Souls and its dumb to compare them, but if Dark Souls didnt exist or for purists with a lot of game knowledge and years under their belt, Kings Field, perhaps even Severance Blade of Darkness, but Im getting derailed Ashen probably wouldnt. And theres a lot of bad design and gameplay choices in Ashen. If it was a walking simulator or something, the art would get it recommended. But its not, its copying Dark Souls in a lot of gameplay points, it will ultimately always be compared to it, and its failing. If youre a die hard fan of soulslikes like me, unfortunately, give it a spin, but wait for a sale. Avoid the Children of Sissna mode unless youre an average achievement hunter again, like me, have controllers to spare, are a practitioner of Zen Buddhism no offense intended to anyone that is or have brushed up on your patience waiting for George Martin to write Winds of Winter. If youre itching for pretty vistas and visuals, there are better ways to spend 30.Take a peek inside the newly opened Cabinet of Curiosities if you like to walk off the beaten path and only sometimes return to the main roads. You might find something worth exploring.Follow the Average Achievement Hunter Curator for reviews and useful information on Steam achievements Theres only 2 problematic achievements, finishing the game and the DLC in Children of Sissna mode. An exercise in patience if there ever was one. Ashen is a beautiful 3D souls-like with platforming and co-op elements set in a fantastical world with a smoothly told story which I sadly cant recommend due to some ideas being not fleshed out or unbalanced, while also having some great moments. Lets dive into it.The game features an amazing stylized art with a great soundtrack, but average sound effects, with its platforming elements giving it a verticality and a sense of exploration thats really good, but falls short as you progress. Individual levels are incredible with narrow corridors leading to new rooms and hidden caves, but enemy placement makes most of the game after the first five hours become a shore, you will have to go through waves of enemies to reach a specific place, and their amount feels highly unbalanced. This is made worse by the complete lack of shortcuts, making levels feel linear and repetitive once you have progressed through them with death playing a large factor into it, dying means having to go through the masses of enemies to get your runes back. You do unlock a form of fast travel, but its not to the entire map, but it doesnt change anything related to backtracking after death.On the topic of runes, this games currency, they are used to upgrade your weapon and purchase items from vendors, and while weapon variety itself isnt that much of an issue, having around a dozen of move sets for the forty or so weapons in the game, its absolutely strange looking at it in conjunction with the inventory system.For the inventory system you have a fixed set of slots, and you unlock some extra storage as you progress through the game, but for some reason this storage is also a fixed amount, which isnt enough to hold even the weapons, shields and armours in the game. Which doesnt make sense with the exploration aspect of the game, it tells you to explore but then youre supposed to discard unique, non buy-able items, because of storage space. This gets even worse when you add consumable and craftable items into the mix as you are introduced to potion crafting which increases the number of slots needed.Crafting potions itself also has another problem, you need specific items bought from another vendor to craft them but the issue is, theres no tracking which items are for each potion outside of the crafting bench which means you must remember the amount of each item, and their cost to figure out how many you can craft, with some potions needing multiple in between items to get to the one you need.Coming back to combat and character progression, armours and shields differ very little between each other, with hardly any reason to use heavy armours and most of them being clear cut improvements. There is also a relic and talisman system allows you to swap minor talisman and relics to increase your character strength, with a few variations allowed but not enough to make builds majorly different.Another combat element are spears, they are your only mean of ranged attacks, which is fine for luring enemies and later turn into a core mechanic when you unlock the ability to warp to statues using them, but unfortunately they also lack variety and increases the storage space issue.The story is nicely told with beautiful cutscenes and NPCs that slowly tie into the story, and they make even the fetch side quests have a nice background to them which made them engaging to finish, this brings us to the town system, which is absolutely incredible and gives a sense of progression as you move through the story.Spoiler for the town system works  As you complete NPCs quests they start to settle into the main town, building larger houses and even getting new outfits. This also ties into unlocking various systems such as the previously discussed potions and relics tables, and while these changes are mostly cosmetic, they are an awesome addition that increase your connection to the world and story. The co-op system features a two player progression through the game, with an AI companion to replace a second player if theres none, you can connect to a specific filter to play with friends which is done based on your progression related to them, which means you will lose the chance to play with a friend if any of you kill a boss the other hasnt. The AI itself is poor, it follows you around and attack whatever youre fighting, but it has trouble disengaging, constantly falls into its death and has trouble deciding when to revive you if youre downed, this ties heavily with exploration, with your death meaning you have to kill every enemy in the vicinity of else the AI will get itself into combat and die without your help.The game features a few bugs, which are small but do add up with all the other stuff, the main one being how enemies will move up objects while attacking, which for some of them mean they can attack without you being able to hit them depending on your weapon, which would be fine if the AI could disengage so the enemy gets unstuck.Lastly on the topic of enemies, theres less than a dozen variation of enemies, which are reused in different areas, with bosses having a better design but not being mechanically challenging, with an honourable mention to the last boss being harder than anything else in the game by a long margin.Ashen sits at a final score of 6.5 for me, with some great ideas bogged down by a lack of balancing. I would say get this game if you have someone to play with to mitigate some of the AI issues. I was really determined to like this game. The artstyle is exactly the sort of thing I love, and the combat was familiar enough while still doing its own thing. The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, at least most of the time, and while most of the characters are boring their voice actors are dramatic enough in their line deliveries to warrant the occasional laugh.But my god. Its such a friggin SLOG.After a while, the combat stopped being fun and became very tedious. The weapon variety isnt interesting--essentially an assortment of clubs and axes--and eventually the urge to enter into battle with a strategy just gave way to a bored mashing of R1, R2, and B. The intricacies of combat that you see in the best soulslikes just arent here. And even worse, like a third of your deaths dont end up feeling like your fault.The way quests work in this game is...obnoxious, for want of a better word. Every time I ventured out from Vagrants Rest I couldnt help but feel like I was carrying a shopping list. The presence of an AI companion didnt help. In fact it sometimes made it worse this game is balanced for co-op, but without someone in the copilots seat the companions tend to be very, very stupid.What else, what else...well, the environments are very pretty. Even the sinister parts, like Nightstorm Isle or the Gnaw, were eye-catching enough that Ive taken my fair share of screenshots. But it just doesnt feel like theres much to DO in all those landscapes--pick up the next MacGuffin, buy some eggs, hit those guys with your big stick. It starts to grate on you after a while. You start to wonder why the fuck youre even out here. The gameplay loop simply isnt complex or varied enough to maintain your interest for that long.I got to the final boss in Ashen. Ran at her I think a dozen times or so, with fully upgraded weapons and the best shield I could find in the game. On maybe a third of those runs, I got to the final half of her final phase. But after getting one-shotted by that spider-crawl attack again, I suddenly realized that I just...Didnt Care. Im not invested enough in the game to pick my controller back up and take another run at it. The final boss fight is BORING, and I cant imagine anything after that being worth the effort of beating it.Im sorry, A44. I really tried to like Ashen, and I really wish I could recommend it. But I cant. Please use this artstyle for something more interesting, because Id like to see it again. Just not...yknow, here. This is not a properrated review as I usually do nor will I add it in my curator page since I did not finish the game but I have to stop playing due to extremely flawed gameplay design choices which amp up 10 times in its dlc which I foolishly bought, and I do need to inform the buyers.Ashen is a souls-like game but unlike any souls-like game the backtracking in Ashen is an absolute fucking mess. If you die you will have to walk or run endlessly through mobs of enemies back to your souls. Unlike other souls-like games where the metroidvania design comes into place, Ashen lacks it completely. What I mean by that, in Dark Souls for example you could unlock several shortcuts or even make your own shortcuts to bosses or other places in case you ever died on your journey. Ashen does not have that. Worse, if you do see a path below or somewhere faster to a boss youll be greeted by an invisible wall of death. This design is in a game where you have to go through incredibly tight, long and dark dungeons with the only checkpoint being at the start of it.Now youre probably thinking you can get stronger by farming and whatnot. False. Ashen does not have a leveling system or main character stats and the only thing you upgrade is your health or stamina which is done automatically when you complete boring side quests. The souls you collect are used to buy stuff and upgrade the damage of the weapons you encounter. Surely there has to be better weapons to make things better right or some nice rewards for all this terrible game design right? Nope. Everything you find is absolutely worthless. You can upgrade the weapons you fight at the start of the game and they can most likely last you the entire game. Armors are not upgradeable and are pretty much worthless. I saw no difference from 30 stamina loss compared to 0 loss for example.The dlc I was playing that made me stop is a huge linear path that can last 30 or more minutes from the checkpoint to the boss with no shortcuts. If you try to rush youll be greeted by enemies that auto-pin you down, ranged auto-locks and other shenanigans. At that point I did not ever care about my lost souls. I just wanted to get this over with but I couldnt even rush the boss because the worst aspect of the game is the fucking partnercoop mechanic. You are sorta dependable on the AI or real player partner and since I did not think a real player would be mandatory I decided to just go with the AI which is a piece of shit. It will get stuck, it will die pointlessly, it will dissapear, it will fuck up your game more than you can count and fighting the enemies without it is just being fucking crazy because no stats means enemies can just fucking 2 shot you regardless of your huge health bar. Even the armors you find are a fucking joke in the DLC, they basically change your appearance to characters you meet in the main game. What kind of sick joke is that? What the fuck were they thinking? A souls-like game  that does not reward exploration? A metroidvania exploration without shortcuts? What a fucking shame because the world and atmosphere is pretty and mysterious but I just cant go through one more minute of its boring and terrible gameplay design. I played far worse games and still managed to finish them but this is just a mess. Do not buy this game. Its like they knew they made something flawed, took the Epic cash and just bailed on the game. It actually pains me a lot to recommend no to this game.The first 5 hours were absolutely delightful. The atmosphere is great, gameplay feels good, the design is smooth. You can feel the souls-like influence but the game does not feel at all like Dark Souls. It has its own feeling, much more forgiving and very enjoyable.But the next 5 to 10 hours, it starts feeling boring. Enemies are the same, exploration is very meaningless because you only loot the same consumables, quest are all the same old  go pick up that item here etc...So, after the awe effect of the first hours, boredom slowly takes it away. I quit after 12 hours, almost at the end already. I figured out I was playing it just because I started it, not because I had fun anymore. And it makes me sad because it started all so well Hard to decide if i was gonna press yes or no. Heres the deal. Game is fun, BUT, the co-op experience is very annoying, not helping, really frustrating, throw ur computer out of the window angry. Lovely maps and dungeons, BUT, if a player dies in a dungeon, hole party have to leave dungeon and do it all over again. Pros- Game has a nice atmosphere.- Beautiful locations that tease you to explore and locate their treasures.- The peculiar aesthetics were refreshing.- Nice-looking UI.- Ok soundtrack that blends really well with the games atmosphere.Cons- Combat can become boring due to lack of move variety and few different tools at your disposal. You have a bunch of axes, a bunch of clubs both have one-hand and two-hand versions and some spears as your ranged weapon.- Forgettable story and lore. - Loot gets disappointing after a while. I would give the mid-game of Ashen the name of Spear Head because thats the only thing that i was finding for a while in corpses.- The online is pretty much dead unless you have a friend or request help on the internet.- Companion AI is like Russian Roulette, there are moments that the thing is fightning the boss with the competence of a human player, other times they are throwing themselves off cliffs and making charged attacks against the wind while youre killed by a spirit that just pinned you down and wombo comboed your ass.- You can disable the AI partner but eventually youll either have to enable it again or equip a certain perk to able to open important doors that can only be opened by two people.- Both inventory and storage system are too small. If youre a completionist, youre going to be mad because you cant store all the games items and still have space to store potions and certain items.- The hard mode of this game is disappointing. Its just normal mode with your hp and stamina cut in half. Any possible enhancements to both collectables and quests had their adding values cut in half as well. TL,DR Ashen is a meh souls clone. If youre curious about the worldatmosphere, wait for a generous discount. Youre not losing much by not playing it. So I think the major issue with this game is mostly due to a mismatch between the depth it provides, and the depth its core demographic would want.  On its own, I think its an okay game I wouldnt go nominating it for any awards but its a fine way to kill some time.  I think the issue though is that its very much babies first soulslike.  Theres no parrying, no backstabs, pretty much no variety in movesets, levelling is mostly done passively and the only real input you get is with a very limited number of equipables, theres no magic, very little variety in scenery, very little enemy variety theres a lot of different types of enemies, but most of them only vary in weapon speed, the bosses are okay but arent overly interesting, the lore is shallow, combat feels a little sluggish and isnt overly satisfying, the world is an entirely sequential set of areas stacked end to end.  Im sure I could go on, but in short what Im saying is it feels like if you wanted to make the most basic soulslike game possible.The issue, I think, is that those who are looking out for new soulslike games, and those whod be sold by phrases like souls with a twist or Ashen takes liberally from Dark Souls ... are probably already fans of the genre.  So unfortunately it means that this stripped down version of a soulslike is likely to feel lacklastre to the sort of people that were interested in buying the game in the first place, and I dont think the couple of unique things it adds passive coop and slightly enhanced traversal are anywhere near enough to make up for it.  So to reiterate, Im ultimately giving this game a negative review because I dont think this game will be enjoyable for the people that are actually likely to buy.  If youve never played any of the soulsborne games, or perhaps thought they were too complicated, this game may appeal to your more.  That said, even in isolation I think the game is only okay at best, so make youre own judgement on whether youre happy to pay 30 for a game thats only okay It is a decent length, if thats your primary concern when assessing a games value. Even though I enjoyed Ashen and even completed every side quest I think its hard to recommend. If you havent played any Dark Souls games I wouldnt recommend Ashen. Play Dark Souls instead! If you have tried any Dark Souls game and didnt like its hard for me to imagine that you would like Ashen. Ashen copies almost all of its design decisions very obviously from Dark Souls the two major differences are how it handles multiplayer which feels like a regression and platformingjumping which I think is an improvement. If you have played all of the Dark Souls games and want more of the same -- even if it means putting up with some frustrating flaws -- you might enjoy Ashen. It has some very good ingredients, but the final product feels somehow less than the sum of its good parts.If you are still reading, let me list some of the things that I liked about the gameI think the best part about Ashen is the environment and the art style. The game not only looks fantastic you can look at screenshots to judge whether you like the look, but the environments are also really well designed with an impressive attention to detail. The visual artists and world builders of this game knocked it out of the park! If exploring beautiful fantasy environments is something that you enjoy then it might be enough to balance out some of the bad things. I really cant say enough about how much I enjoyed Ashen visually.When your character jumps in Ashen its usually possible to catch hold of ledges and pull yourself up. This may seem minor, but I found that it made exploring and trying to get to out-of-the-way areas much more fun for me than in Dark Souls games. This was a welcome addition that I really liked.There is a homebase area that growschanges as the game progresses think e.g. Majula in Dark Souls 2. Although the concept is by no means unique I felt like the execution in Ashen was really well done. It was always a pleasure to return and see what was new. New buildings dont just appear out of nowhere you see them being built and progressing, which was satisfying.When it comes to the bad things about the game I am not going to try and list all of my complaints. My biggest complaint is that Ashen so obviously copied the Dark Souls formula but almost invariably in a way that was not quite as good, and so the whole experience kind of felt disappointing. It was hard not to find myself thinking yeah, this is familiar, but it was better in Dark Souls.Rather than listing everything that I didnt like I will try to just mention some things here that might help you decide whether you would want to play or notThere is an interesting approach to multiplayer. It is interesting in the sense that I think it could lead to some really interesting emergent gameplay and situations, and I can imagine what the designers maybe had in mind, but it felt like the final product somehow doesnt work. The game itself doesnt explain anything or, as far as I know, give any indication that multiplayer is happening I read the store page description after finishing the game and realized that it tells you much more than the game ever does maybe I was expected to read that before playing? . The important point if youre considering whether to play Ashen is that it is pretty clearly designed to be played with two players in terms of enemy and boss strategy and difficulty, but unless you know how the game mechanic works and intentionally make a plan with a friend you will either be playing with a stranger who may or may not have the same goals that you do or an AI companion who is not particularly competent and will often die often from walking off ledges and leave you alone.Once I figured out what was happening I turned off the human multiplayer so that I was exclusively playing with an AI companion. I generally liked having an AI friend going through the game with me, but you should absolutely be prepared for frustration when your companion does inexplicably dumb things.The storylore in Ashen felt really unsatisfying to me. You know that feeling in Dark Souls games of I have no idea whats going on in the story, but you feel like if you take the time to read item descriptions and watch enough YouTube videos you will be able to figure it out and it will be amazing? In Ashen I had no idea what was going on in the story, but also had a sneaking suspicion that there maybe wasnt anything going on. I avoided spoilers on my playthrough, but when I was finished I tried to find explanations of the story and lore to see what I had missed, and I couldnt really find anything. If you like Dark Souls games for the lore you will probably be disappointed with Ashen.Almost all of the side quests consist of follow a quest marker on the map, either kill an enemy or pick up an item, and then return to home base. In a handful of exceptions there might be a character at the quest marker who had some dialog, but most of the time the game relied on you and your imagination to make the quests meaningful, and hoped that the dialog before and after would be enough of a reward. You might be thinking well, yeah, in video games every quest boils down to going somewhere, killing something or picking up an item, and returning, but in Ashen it isnt just that quests boil down to that, its that theres nothing else to even boil down. The quest writers did their best with coming up with back stories to explain what you were doing, but none of that was ever integrated in any way into the actual experience. This made me feel very detached from the actual story that my character was experiencing. On the one hand I grew to like the NPC characters I met because they were actual companions and went exploring with me and fought by my side when they werent plummeting to their deaths, but on the other hand I didnt feel involved at all with the alleged stories of the quests that they gave me. My attachment was through shared experience, but I really couldnt have cared less about what the game tried to convince me was going on in their lives because it seemed completely unrelated to the experiences we were actually having.The combat was competently done, and if you love Dark Souls combat you would probably find it pretty fun. The problem, though, is that it gets kind of old There is an almost bewildering lack of weapon diversity. There are lots of different weapons, but they almost all behave the same, with minor differences in damage or speed and occasionally moveset. Every time I would get a new weapon I would dutifully try it out, only to think yep, its another axe that seems the same as every other axe Ive found. There is a surprising amount of enemy instances compared to enemy diversity. The actual amount of enemy types is respectable, but you will fight so many of them especially if, like me, youre not too skilled and have to repeat sections because you die that eventually you may get tired of fighting them. There are some sections with clever enemy placement, but unfortunately I think there are more sections where the enemy placement is predictable, challenging because of quantity rather than cleverness, and kind of tired and familiar.So, to summarize What kept me going was the desire to explore the awesome environments. The storylore was mildly interesting at first, but by about the halfway point I had lost all interest and I say this as someone who generally really cares about narrative in games. The combat system was done well and was like an old familiar glove because of its similarity to Dark Souls, but the combat itself grew pretty tedious by the end.It is strange to have so many bad things to say about a game that I put so many hours into. Clearly I enjoyed it enough despite its flaws to keep coming back for more, and maybe if youre still reading this you would too! Pros- Good graphic style.- Nice sound design and voice-acting,- Pretty casual for soulslike game, so perfect for beginners in the genre.Cons- Combat system is dull and gets old really fast.- Weapons do not progress in any way - you basically just get new skins for weapons with same stats and moves throughout the game.- Boss design is uninspired, all bosses have nearly the same moveset and are too easy to beat.- Co-op is atrocious. You wont make it work without the help of Google, and even after that youll experience some issues and god forbid one of you shall die in the dungeon, you may aswell just start over cause game wont sync you. Very cool light souls setting and premise, but feels unfinished and poorly balanced. On the upside, I really enjoyed the town building aspect, as people you meet in the world move to your town and gradually fill it with beautiful buildings. There are also several beautiful moments in the game, including one where a whale-like creature flies low overhead. On the downside, every weapon is virtually identical, every armor set which cant be upgraded is just 5 defense higher than the previous armor set, and worst of all the game is bottlenecked about 5 hours into the main quest by a dungeon where you have to fight the same super-strong enemies over and over, in total darkness so you have to use a one-handed weapon with no shield so you can hold your lantern on thin platforms over bottomless pits, with no checkpoints or shortcuts. This is both incredibly boring and incredibly frustrating, and killed my interest in the game. Also disappointing is the fact that, like other Souls-borne games, there are lots of hidden nooks and crannies with items in them, but because this games systems are so shallow there arent really any cool things they can put there, so the reward is always a small sack of money or an item that you could just buy back in town.If you do decide to give it a try, be sure to start by TURNING OFF MULTIPLAYER. Everything in the game is designed to be played with a companion with multiplayer off, the game will give you a serviceable AI companion. With multiplayer on, the game will give you the same AI companion, but he will abruptly disappear from time to time including in the middle of combat as the game searches for a human player to join you, which it usually fails to find, and then does not give you back the AI companion, leaving you with no companion at all. I really wanted to like this game. The art style is what initially caught my attention, because its pretty nice and unique. The storysetting are nothing special, pretty standard Dark Souls-esque atmosphere and lore, but I did appreciate that instead of a typical medieval aesthetic they went for more of a primitive Norse vibe. The hub town growing as you progress through the game is also very satisfying, starting out as a bunch of bandits squatting in tents among some abandoned ruins and then gradually coming to life as more NPCs move in, begin construction on proper houses, and clean up the rubble. Wanting to see how the town turned out was pretty much the only thing that kept me playing after the first couple hours. Unfortunately, wandering around a cute virtual viking town isnt a strong enough motivation to slog through 20 hours of bare-bones, repetitive and clunky gameplay. The main problem with Ashen is that, aside from the art style, it feels... unfinished, I guess? Like a group of programmers got an assignment to make their own Dark Souls game, spent all their time on the art, and then had to slap everything else together in a hurry because the assignment is due tomorrow and the teachers going to be mad if its not done. The combat is extremely basic- attack, dodge out of the way, attack again, repeat until either you or the enemy dies. Theres no counterattackparry mechanic, no stealth or methods of inflicting bonus damage, no magic to supplement melee, and the only ranged combat throwing spears is pretty much useless against anything that moves faster or has more health than the lowest-level starting enemies. The enemy variety is lacking, with most enemies being humanoid bandits who do basic lunge attacks. There are a few animalcreature enemies, but despite having significantly different anatomy than the human enemies larger size, extra limbs, ability to spit acid, etc fighting them doesnt require you to switch up your strategy of attackdodgeattack, even though youd think that fighting a giant crab would need a different approach than fighting some guy with an axe. There are no stats or levels to speak of, with the only way to permanently improve your character being staminahealth upgrades obtained either by completing quests or by collecting feathers sparsely hidden across the map, upgrading the damage output of your weapons, or finding entirely new weaponsarmor. Character builds are limited to whether you mainly use a 1H melee weapon with a shield or 2H melee, and which talismans you have equipped- except you can only equip four at a time, it costs money to switch them out, and the benefits they provide are generally minor and passive. These things wouldnt necessarily be a huge problem if the game was exploration-focused and combat was secondary, but A combat is what youll spend most of Ashen doing, and B the exploration is arguably even more half-baked than the combat. You see, theres quite a bit of exploration in Ashen- there are lots of hidden nooks and crannies, loot that can only be accessed by platforming, out-of-the-way caves, and so on. However, it quickly becomes apparent that there isnt much incentive to actually explore all these areas, because the weapon and loot variety is absolutely abysmal. The majority of the loot you find in the game seemingly exists only to clog up your inventory space with endless stacks of the same half-dozen or so items. Oh, by the way, there are fewer than 20 inventory slots and chances are theyll all be full before youre halfway through the second area of the map. Not a huge deal, just stick the stuff youre not using in a storage container in the hub... except the storage container doesnt appear until youve already progressed through a decent amount of the game in other words, AFTER youve likely had to dump half your inventory and it also has a severely limited number of slots. Theres not enough storage to hold the various weapons youll pick up which are all technically one-of-a-kind, let alone your weapons, armor AND the five billion crafting ingredients the game throws at you. You cant even sell excess weapons for money or break them down into crafting material, as far as I can tell- you just have to drop them on the ground and let them despawn. Not that youll be particularly attached to most of your weapons, since 90 of them are some variation of an axe or a club which all share extremely similar animations with bland designs and only minor stat differences, and for some inexplicable reason the crappy weapons you get at the start of the game have better damage stats than at least half of the stuff you find later. Presumably theres some kind of trade-off between raw damage and attack speedcombo potential, but I didnt notice much of a difference outside of a few particular items. Theres pretty much only a handful of new armorclothing items to find, they cant be upgraded, many of them impose stamina penalties, and they tend to be fairly ugly too, so I ended up spending a good chunk of the game just continuing to wear the hobo rags your character starts with. This lack of variety also plagues the map design, which is a shame because, again, the art style is really nice. Initially I assumed that the barren landscape of the starting area would soon give way to more varied environments, but a large portion of the map is very similar in appearance. Eventually you reach some areas that are more colorful and unique, but only after hours of trudging through dusty hills, rocky cliffs, stone ruins, and dying trees, all rendered in muted grays and browns and blues. The feeling of repetition is only made worse by the aforementioned lack of enemy variety and the absence of any meaningful buildsplaystyles. In the end, thats what killed Ashen for me. Not the admittedly clunky controls or difficulty spikes although those are also problems but the fact that theres simply no motivation to keep playing once you realize that this is all its going to be. Youre not going to find some cool new weapon in that cave, its just going to be another axe or club that probably has worse stats than what youre already carrying. Youre not going to snag a piece of unique loot or some secret lore by exploring thoroughly, its just going to be more broken spearheads and warp items youll never use and a generic NPC that recites all the same generic NPC lines. Youre not going to run into a unique enemy by going off the beaten path, its just going to be a dozen more bandits with another giant crab thrown in if youre lucky. Youre not going to witness an interesting plot twist or unique piece of worldbuilding by pushing through the main quest, because the story is just a simplified rehash of every other Soulslike game once-great kingdom has fallen into ruin, endless cycle of societal collapse and rebirth, light vs darkness, you have to fight the former ruler of the kingdom as one of the endgame bosses, etc. The only thing that provides a consistent and satisfying sense of progression is watching the town grow and improve over time, but thats not enough for a 40 game. All that being said, Ashen isnt an iredeemably awful game. I found the exploration and combat to be decently engaging for the first few hours, the art is beautiful, and the premise works perfectly fine. With some more effort put into fleshing out the mechanics, increasing the variety of lootenemies, providing more reward for exploration, and tweaking some of the more needlessly frustrating dungeonsbosses, Ashen could be a solid Dark Souls-inspired action adventure game. As it is now, it feels like an interesting demoprototype thats been stretched too thin and slapped with a full-sized price tag. Ive never played a game with as much wasted potential as Ashen. Save yourself the time, money, and heartache. Do not purchase this game. It pains me to say this, but as good as the art direction, sound design, and premise were, they couldnt carry this game.First and foremost, the game markets itself as a soulslike, but it fails to copy the things that made the Dark Souls series a good experience. From the footage that I saw, I was expecting this game to be somewhat of an open-world something like a prerequisite to FromSoftwares Elden Ring. This is a sham. Do not fall for this. I really like to explore and check every nook and cranny, but unfortunately Ashen spits in your face for exploring. Youll be finding the same 2 to 4 upgrade materials until the end of the game. Sometimes youll find a homeward bone. Oh goody. By that time, youll be swimming in them. I actually started to ignore item drops or play a game with my stream. I would joke, Hey what do you guys think this is? Any guesses for a Sapient Root? And of course the item would be a Sapient Root. The developers also sprinkled these black and white feathers throughout the world that increase your health and stamina respectively when picked up. These were few and far between and were not a great enough incentive to make me suffer through the games lackluster combat.This games combat sucks a fat one. Everything that you liked about Souls is pretty much thrown out the window. Parries are nonexistent, instead being replaced with a useless shield bash. Things are... clunky to say the least. Swinging your weapon never feels quite right and in the end, it all boils down to R1 spam to deal the most damage. Furthermore, enemies consistently have way too much health and act as damage sponges even if your weapons are thoroughly upgraded. I knew I was in for a rough time when the starting pleb enemies didnt just take one or two hits to kill. Enemy placement is straight diabolical in this game, forcing you to wade through massive mobs of enemies that can stun-lock you before you get to the next shrine bonfire. If you try to run past them, goodluck. You just have take them down one at a time with R1 spam. Nothing changes. There is no variety to gameplay. You just press R1 and dodge. The game became very boring and hard to finish towards the end because of this.The RPG systems here are extremely flawed by design. You cannot level your characters stats up in this game with souls. The only way to become stronger is to complete NPC questlines, all of which are indicated by quest markers on your map. All of them are travel to x area, talk to x NPC, find x item, or kill x enemy. Souls are relegated to purchasing upgrades in the form of maximum gourd estus capacity, gourd effectiveness and total healing, weapon upgrades, talismanrelic swapping, spear crafting, and potion crafting.Nows a good time to get into the relic and talisman system. As you progress through the game, you unlock more talismans and relics. You can equip up to 4 talismans at once. Talismans do various things. To give examples Your Crimson Gourds Swig capacity is increased, Your charged attacks deal bonus Damage, Your Health is increased greatly, Your Stamina is increased greatly, etc. I like to think of them as rings from Dark Souls except every time you want to remove a ring you have to pay 1,000 souls to do so. Nice. Talismans are more interesting and you can only equip one of these. They change the way you play the game. To give examples Heals you for a portion of your Damage dealt, Your successful charged attacks cause a small explosion dealing bonus Damage and Stun, Orbs appear when striking enemies, dealing bonus damage based on your weapon. Orbs disappear when you are hit, etc. To swap these out, you must pay 10,000 souls to do so. Way to encourage experimentation!Weapon variety sucks. Everything pretty much has the same moveset... Therefore invalidating those hundreds of extra upgrade materials you have sitting around. Nothing is special, there are no unique weapon arts or anything of the sort. Just a handful of weapon types with different skins. Since it all boils down to R1 spam anyway, just pick whichever swings the fastest. All weapons can be upgraded to ridiculous levels, so Im pretty sure that you could grab a club towards the beginning of the game and it would be usable endgame, being only slightly worse than an end game max upgraded club by 20 or so damage. Armor sets that you find are strictly static upgrades to your defense. Bummer.Also you have an NPC companion. They help with how many swarms of damage sponge enemies there are. Sometimes there will be a ledge thats too high to climb up to by yourself. Youll have to use them and perform an awkward buddy-lift command. Goodluck getting them to do this!The handful of bosses that exist in this game are awful and frustrating because gameplay lacks depth. The world is not truly open-world. Sure you can explore, but most caves you find will be small and contain nothing besides a Sapient Root or two. Maybe a new set of armor if youre lucky. You will be railroaded onto a set path if you wish to progress through the game. Ashen had a lot of interesting ideas and what it does well, it does well. I like how much it commits to darkness and forcing the player to utilize a lantern. The art direction is sublime. The few fleshed out dungeons that it does have were great. Plus, there are some dope moments and cutscenes. However, they are not worth playing through this slog of a game just to see. Youre better off looking them up on YouTube if youre interested.Overall, avoid at all costs. Big souls fan, cant get enough of these types of games. If youre a big souls fan and youre thirsty for a lesser known souls-like game DONT get this game, youll probably be disappointed.I liked this game at first but I slowly began disliking it for various reasons, most of which has been covered in other negative reviewsNo weapon variety - Its either a club type or an axe type. Axes give crit, Clubs gives stun and a bit more dmg but no crit. They pretty much all have the same animations. Not very exciting.Combat is janky and very one dimensionalExploration is not rewarding at allShields are pretty much useless, as youll need your lantern most of the time - specially late gameMy biggest complaint though is the atrocious boss runs, what an awful and frustrating decision. I was on the last boss in the DLC and the main game, I ended up quitting and uninstalling. Each boss had extremely long death runs  with a ton of enemies in between them and your death point, the DLC boss run has tons of enemies that actually pin you as youre running, its a grand time! The game is beautiful, has a nice combat system and is a pleasing experience... Untill you feel that it is lacking variety. I dont understand why to put RPG features in a game with so little options to work with, so I feel that this game could be a far better experience if the devs went for another direction in terms of game design. That made me go from excitement disappointment and quit the game. Then I tried playing it again after a while, but the feeling was the same. WARNING! If you are looking for a good coop multiplayer experience, Ashen is NOT it.  I wish someone had warned me before my friend and I bought this game, so I am taking a moment to let others know who might be thinking about buying Ashen for the coop.  Ashen uses what it calls passive multiplayer, which is probably one of the worst multiplayer setups Ive ever encountered.  In order for you and a friend to play together, each of you must have finished the tutorial mission, then you must travel to a location outside of your base area, and both of you must be at the same point point in the story and have the same code dialed into your multiplayer setting, at which point you will both join each others games automatically btw, none of this is explained in the game or menus- youtube and google did the devs job for them.  Your character will appear as a story npc to your friend, and vice-versa. Totally lame and feels virtually broken! I have absolutely no idea why a game developer would implement such a convoluted and difficult multiplayer system, but it wrecks what might have been a good game otherwise.  As I mentioned before, coop is why I bought the game if I had known about Ashens passive multiplayer nonsense before, I would not have purchased it. I found this game to be boring at best, frustrating at worst. By all counts this shouldve been a nice, stripped-down souls-like experience. You gain max HP  stamina through completing main and side quests. You use souls to level up your weapons and flask. Theres a map and even markers that show you where to complete the quests you get! However, there are 3 massive difficulty spikes that ruin it for me. The dungeons of which there are 2 are terrible. Pitch-black areas that force you to use a lantern  1H weapon combo, lots of enemies everywhere, especially around corners to sucker punch you and an AI partner that will preemptively kill itself by rolling off cliffs, ledges and other edges. These dungeons also take forever, easily 20-30 minutes, to clear. Normally that wouldnt be so bad, but there are no checkpoints inside. Every time you die you have to redo the entire thing. The first one is especially bad, as even reaching the boss doesnt save anything. Die to the boss? Get ready to do the entire thing again! At least the 2nd dungeon gives you a checkpoint at the end of it, just before the boss. And then theres the final boss. Inaccurate hitboxes, massive damage output, constant dodging, 2 phases and an AI partner that will roll off the platform and die every chance it gets. I decided to do the same during my last attempt and rolled off the edge after it, before uninstalling the game.Technically, at least on Steam Deck, the game was a mess. One zone in particular ran at 15-18 FPS. Decreasing the resolution scale and the settings did not increase it at all. Even when looking back in the direction of the zone would tank the FPS. There was also an issue when using the map specifically that would freeze the game, forcing me to restart. This happened over a dozen times. The games amazing art style, great sense of scale and beautiful music arent enough to overcome the frustration for me. I wanted, so badly, for this game to be fun.  There are a lot of really enjoyable elements however the game is still quite unpolished in terms of combat mechanics.  1 It is unlikely that the stock companion is ever going to follow you.  He may show up on occasion to help out with some baddies, but otherwise, hes no help.2 forced multiplayer that overrides the npc character sounds like a great idea, but really is absolutely awful...  Get ready to consistently be paired with people who dont give a crap about the game and will blow past everything you want to do and leave you to deal with the bosses.3 lesser, but still annoying, I hate games that have archers who are beyond deadly accurate, especially when those archers are actually throwing spears, and are vagrants, who, lorewise, are supposed to be feralcrazed humans.  But that doesnt change how deadly accurate they are with a spear of 10yds no matter how quickly you move.  I still love the look of the game, it is absolutely beautiful, but unplayable with how frequently you are force-paired with people who have no care in the world for helping you with the game. -------------negatives----------------------Its okay. The gameplay is good.. but the combat falls flat in many areas. Some weapons have special abilities but their really isnt any motivation to use em since the PvE is mostly flat, a bit unbalanced, and I got through the whole game using 3 of the same weapons anyways. Majority of enemies will just drop the same 2-3 items, and the only time I remember really using a dodge roll was against bosses.Bosses are okay. Last one is severely unbalanced, but goes down with time.I recommend using a controller even if youre able to remap your controls to your liking. Spears are fun to use but the annoying thing is my talisman gets in the way of my aim.-----------------positive-----------------------------The best part about this title is the world though! fantastic vistas and many environments really make me feal like exploring! ... sadly their isnt much keeping me exploring other than arrow heads and crafting materials. the eagerness to explore and hopefully find a good treasure or weapon died about 5-6 hours in.The NPC helpers and various shops you unlock pretty standard but their isnt much to say. Youll have more fun watching your partner get stuck in a random spot in the game, clip away, then re-appear AFTER you needed it most.the giant fish lady is really cool.---------------closing---------------------Ashen has great elements and I LOVED the environments but theirs just not enough to keep me playing longer than I have to, which is a shame since I did find myself loving the experience travelling this creative and fun-looking world! Overall though I felt it lacking and sorely wishing that in time something would happen to keep me invested and yet my breath is still held waiting.I wanted to recommend this to peeps since it looked cool but I cant. hopefully the next title tightens up the combat. Its pretty good at the beginning, but the game has no variety. What you do in the very good first few hours of the game is identical to the end. The mediocre gameplay is tolerable when you feel wonder while exploring, but as it goes on, the game becomes a gankfest and you have NO tools to defend yourself.Cant recommend such a frustrating experience.",
        "summary": "The game could be recommended just on the merits of its art, sound direction and world building, but it has gameplay issues and bad design choices that take it down a few notches. Its visually stunning, adopting a cartoonish look that still conveys all the desolation, dread and haunting atmosphere as easily as it does the warmth and colors of your slowly emerging town."

        "text": "First time with a Dark Souls type game and loving it. I am 52 so apparently its never too late to get good. If you rush you can make it the hardest Souls game youve ever played. If you take it a bit slower, it will be similar in difficulty to the old games. If you take it very slow and out-level content it also fits the bit more casual player, although dont think it will be easy.The open world and questing system are the new benchmark for the entire genre. For me its one of the best games Ive ever played.Opinion might change along the way as I am only half way, will update accordingly. This game feels like...walking out into Hyrule field after the Great Deku tree. I did not think I would ever experience such an overwhelming feeling of amazement again. Please bring back this level of gaming. Im so tired of paying 14.99 for skimpy DLC and 29.99 season passes. Just give us complete works like Elden Ring. I promise youll get all our money.And honestly? This game is the new example in evaluating all others. Why should you pay 60 for a game thats not even half as complete as Elden Ring? First game in a long time where you get exactly what you payed for and exactly what was advertised, no micro transactions, no battle pass, just a massive playground where the only one limiting your enjoyment and progression is you. The only thing as grand and marvelous as the world itself are the horrors attempting to keep you from your goals. Elden ring is as hard as you make it.Flaws are few and far between a few npc quests were unfinished and guess what, its already been patched-looking at you coz!. I wish other game developers put as much love, care, and dedication to its games, its fans, and its employees as FromSoftware has. My advice, explore the world when you get stuck on a boss, go off the beaten path, strike first, strike hard, No mercy. Honest Review from an Old CodgerFirst impressions and on the fence I am an older gamer and a father of 4 boys. Elden Ring was the first game for me in the Souls-Series that I have really played. I did buy Dark Souls 3 and try to play that once it released on Steam, and it took me nearly 3 hours to kill Gundyr only to find myself constantly invaded, and relentlessly killed when I was trying to play with my youngest son, Griffin afterwards. Needlessly to say, I quickly put that game down and moved on with my life. Years later, my sons showed me Elden Ring and I fell in love with the trailer. My wife encouraged me to try it and be open maybe this would be a better experience. Time would tell. My gamers of all age and creed, I have put in 1000 hours in and I have no intentions of stopping.  I told myself that I would give an honest review from my point of view if I ever played the game for 1000 hours.Arising as a Tarnished I can safely say that this game is one of the best games that I have ever played in my life I have played many. I have experienced such a range of emotions of this game, and no matter how many times I failed at a boss or a mechanic, I always knew that I could better myself if I applied myself a nice lesson learned in life that transcends quite well into the gaming universes. Once I was able to get my noodle around the mechanics of this game, I fell in love and I could not put it down I still cannot. You just have to be patient with yourself and believe in yourself. That is one of the many cornerstones of life that leads to success and in these Souls games, it is no different. You can quite literally play the game however you want. Any build you can think of, any style you desire, you can do it here.  Your limits are only set on your imagination and will power.  I have created many different kinds of builds for my complete playthroughs and I never get bored beating the games and repeating the content as a different character from the hit MOBA League of Legends. Support beyond the FogAs an older gamer, and father of 4 boys, my time is limited, and it is always an opportunity cost when learning how to play a new game. The community that surrounds Elden Ring are amazing as well, which was very strange at first. I did not expect a game, that is heavily singleplayer, to have an immense amount of care, and support from a community. From this community, the amount of resources of knowledge and guidance they give, often reminds me of my first time playing Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest and the original World of Warcraft.  From wikis to video playthroughs, and everything in between, anything you could possibly want to know, and answers to the questions that you did not think you could have, the community has your back. Keep this in mind if you are ever stuck in this game, or on the fence about this game. The resources are there for you, the support from the community is there for you both in and out of game. Shout out to Fextralife, Fightincowboy, Giggathiccas, Onion Samurai, Titus Actual, YMAH the goat, and Steelovsky for helping me in all aspects of the game. If you are ever struggling, please look any of those up on how to better yourselves in PvE or the PvP Aspects of the game. A Seamless Land, that is as vast as the oceansWhen I reached the 25 hours mark, I told my wife that this game reminded me a lot of Nintendos 1998 hit classic Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. That world space was so vast for its time, it was like nothing that the world of gaming has ever seen before.  Seamlessly wondering around, adventuring around, didnt matter if you got lost or hit a dead end, I was so engaged back then to explore and find what wonders and secrets held, low and behold, Elden Ring delivered that same experience that I had in my youth. That was so captivating for me and it really left an impression on me of what it means to explore in a game and actually enjoy yourself. It has been literally decades since any game has been able to deliver that experience again and trust me, I have bought nearly all those AAA open world games that have sucked in comparison on delivering a wholesome experience. Final ThoughtsWhen I buy a game, I invest my hard earned money AND my limited time in it. I expect to have a good time with my family and friends that also play that game. I took a leap of faith with this game especially after my first experience with a FROMSOFT game was quite miserable LOL not anymore, I have nearly 100 Darksouls III and absolutely love the Dark Souls games, yes including DS II. Needless to say, this game has not only surpassed my expectations, but it has been quite sometime I would say 5 years that I have thoroughly enjoyed myself playing a game. Gamer-Rot is a hard experience to endure and live through as a passionate gamer, and Elden Ring got me out of it. Elden Ring has paved the road for me and my sons to spend more quality time together. Thank you Elden Ring. Try Finger, But Hole. This being my first FromSoftware game, I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as Im not usually a fan of hard content or very good at it, but to my pleasant surprise, it wasnt as daunting as Id thought itd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.The WorldI cant remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a games open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.If I had trouble with a boss or an area, Id just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and theres plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. Creature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.The GameplayMy first playthrough ended up being something like 300 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or leaving fellow players a message!I also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasnt quite yet ready to take on, and there were two specific bosses that I had a really hard time with, but finally beating them felt SO satisfying, and it was worth all the rage Id felt when dying repeatedly to them.The MultiplayerI asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. Its also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon. When youre in a boss arena, you cant be invaded, so if youre worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when youre fighting bosses.Though honestly, the invading wasnt as scary as Id expected, especially when you have the option of asking a hunter for help. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded, times where we got absolutely decimated but also close calls that made us whoop or sigh in relief!Ending ThoughtsI loved the npcs, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly  Also, I dont care what anyone says, Fias hugs are nice and warm.Seeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I cant help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.The only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zone Farum Azula, cough, and it was the only zone I ended up trying to rush through. Moving around the environment was annoying especially because of the enemies. Its also the only location where my game crashed multiple times. I have to say the location boss was awesome though, as was every main boss honestly. The optional boss in the area was also one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.Other than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if youre struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. Suffice to say, Im super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I highly recommend the game! Also, sometimes you really just do need to git guud I never did git guud myself tho.. Every time I hop on this game i either have a great time or am contemplating suicide. Best game ive ever played. Rise, Tarnished!Easily the best game Ive played in many years, and it deserves a longer review than most of you have patience for. I highly recommend it, and heres whyLike many who play this game, this was my first SoulsborneSoulslike game, as it is the most refined and user-friendly version of FromSoftwares game design ethos. I avoided the Dark Souls series for many years. I had a presumptuous view of FromSoftware and their visual aesthetic that made me feel this game was just sad edgelord material. I was so wrong. Like all FromSoftware games, Elden Ring revels in struggle. Only the most basic combat mechanics are explained to the player the rest is trial and error. It challenges you to tease out its mysteries, not just of the world and lore, but of the combat mechanics and UI. The game asks you to STRUGGLE you need to be open to that to fully enjoy it, and oh boy, did I struggle...I struggled to simply navigate the user interface, to find the extra info on weapon damage and scaling, armor ratings and status defenses, even item descriptions full of implicit lore that give the player a small understanding of whats happening in the Lands Between. I struggled to accept that not every field boss in the overworld was meant to be defeated when you first encounter them. I struggled to avoid traps and ambushes. Even when I gave up trying to play solo and attempted to use the Co-Op multiplayer system, I struggled to understand the seemingly obtuse system of items that enable it. Even after, I struggled against skilled and relentless Invaders, many of whom have been invading players since Dark Souls 1. Im ashamed to say I struggled to not uninstall the game and play an easier one with a more forgiving learning curve. Such was my frustration.Most of all, I struggled to get acclimated to the combat mechanics... Until, a whole 40 hours and many deaths in, something clicked. I started seeing and feeling a flow to combat, requiring a skillful dance between dodging perfectly into attacks and identifying narrow windows for my own attacks. I started to understand every movement and attack options purpose and viability in different scenarios. I started understanding how to most efficiently manage my stamina, consumables, and other resources. I started seeing challenges and opportunities where before I only saw difficulties and defeat.This began a shift in my mentality. The developers were not taunting or trolling me, like many players seem to think they were inviting me to experience a true power fantasy, to feel a tangible sense of actual progression in skill and understanding. The game does not say git gud, noob it says rise, Tarnished.So many modern AAA games are released with a product mentality first and foremost, and not even as good products they are often unfinished, rushed, bugged, and bloated with profit-maximizing strategies like microtransactions. Elden Ring is the first game Ive played in a decade that felt like a complete game, full of hundreds of hours of content. So many games frontload their best content and force you to engage with it to force your interest, but much of Elden Rings best content is hidden or blocked by combat and platforming challenges. I have almost 3k hours logged, and Im still finding out new things the game has kept hidden from me. This speaks so much to the confidence the developers have in their vision of an adventure fantasy game centered around discovery.The game is not perfect. There are still some bugs and glitches present from launch that have no clearcut development solution. Many bosses, enemy types, and other assets are re-used all over the map to mixed effect. Some lategame and endgame content feels rushed and spread out. Perhaps worst of all, like all games with an active PvP element, the player community is rife with toxic players who seem hellbent on griefing others into making them uninstall the game.Even with these glaring imperfections, this game shines like a diamond in a sea of coal coated with cheap craft glitter. It stands head and shoulders above almost all other modern AAA games in terms of intrigue, combat satisfaction, exploration, and story, and it doesnt even flaunt it. An understated and nuanced gaming experience is such a delight in an era where games are intended to feel more like blockbuster Hollywood movies rather than progressive adventures. Elden Ring is the culmination of FromSoftwares singular and robust design philosophy, honed over decades of trial and error. If you experience only one Soulsbourne game in your entire life, let it be Elden Ring. TLDRElden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that Ive ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSofts Souls games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. GENREFantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, Souls gameGAMEPLAYElden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build. You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding itemsgear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain runes that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. Sites of grace are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeonssecrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts ashes of war or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a daynight cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.GRAPHICSPERFORMANCEElden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs AMD FX 6300, RX 480 averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugsdetrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closerkilled some of the group this is probably just because my CPU is ancient. In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesnt break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the skylandscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.  STORYThe long story short is the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a Tarnished which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to order. All of the details in between for NPCs and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore videoSTRENGTHSCombat feels the best it has ever been for Souls games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add and remove later a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice if you also have the right whetstone so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didnt.Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible it is a game mechanic after allYou can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthroughThe crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bowcrossbow ammo which is very neat.Just when you think youre near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Rings story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.WEAKNESSESPC performance isnt stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. Not game-relevant, but the game doesnt fully exit when you quit out until a while later.Early game bosses reappear as mini-bosses or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 15 of your HP in damage to 12 of your HP in damage.UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped itemsOnline connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a connection error and the game boots you back to single player. Be wary of hackers when playing co-opPVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers dont just give up.Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios note AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that  of summonable participants is limited. I dont invade, but Ive seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick.Great Runes are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPCs quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.NUMERIC SCORE if you care9.910 easy recommendElden Ring has set my bar for open-world RPG standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the games action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and cant wait for future DLC.  Checkbox reviews are lazy copy  paste bullsht. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. Lets be honest, I only wrote this review for awards is a waste of everyones time. If you are interested in genuine  detailed game reviews, feel free to check out my others here or dont, I dont tell you what to do. Welcome To Elden Ring -A Dying Simulator- This game delivers the entire experience in a way Ive never quite seen. Im new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games. Here are the thoughts Ive spent 200 hours in this game as of writing this and Ive barely left the starting area - Limgrave. My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights. Ive been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldnt change any of it. I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi. Its just a blast. An absolute blast. The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt. You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience. Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster youve gotten is a very rewarding experience.I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as Im not usually a fan of hard content or very good at it, but to my pleasant surprise, it wasnt as daunting as Id thought itd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.I cant remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a games open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.If I had trouble with a boss or an area, Id just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and theres plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. Discover new dungeons, Cave, Hidden Item, Secret Spells, Underground, Mini bosses etc.. Summoning Spirit were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons art was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options In open world amazing quest, beautiful scenery that is pretty enough reason to try it. If youre struggling, and there are plenty of play-styles, magical spells build as well to play with.This is the game which actually teaches you that  Quitting is not an option but dying is Being my first souls game, I was convinced I would be wasting my money, and that the first boss I encountered would kick my ass. And I was proven right in no time, by the Grafted Scion. But you were expected to be defeated by that one!, you say. Worry not, the Tree Sentinel was also quick to put me back in my place once I had built the tiniest bit of confidence after beating the tutorial boss.The game is fantastic. It got more and more rewarding as I progressed, and I was happy to beat the game a second and a third time, finding out new secrets during each playthrough. Theres no compliment I can come up with that hasnt already been used to describe this game.There are so many weapons with so many different builds to try. Bosses can be frustrating but theres so much fun to be had. Even what is considered to be one of the toughest fights looking at you, Malenia is incredibly fair and fun. And the spectral horse you get is most likely the best horse Ive ever ridden in any game, ever.If I had anything to complain about, are the platforming sections. But after looking it up a bit, apparently FromSoftware never really knew how to do those, and they are so few and far between, thats hardly a reason not to buy the game.I could also complain that I was unable to romance Boggart or Blaidd. Theyre so cool.1010, the DLC cannot come a day too soon. So, I came into this game as a person who hates the Souls-genre. Im not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like Nah, i wont like it.. Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to win the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. Thats when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where its rare that a game actually keeps my attention. I was absolutely hooked from start to finish with this game. This game reminded me how much I missed exploring an immense open-world and how gaming industries have lowered my standards over the years. No unnecessary guidances, no go-and-pick-some-flowers to craft healing portions constantly, no warnings. The only thing the game requires is people to explore this open-world. Beautifully written. I dont think I will be obssesed with a game like this for a long time. Since the release of Skyrim on 111111 I have been craving an open world experience with rewarding combat, build theories, crazy-beautiful aesthetics, and a real sense of accomplishment items, dungeons completed, etc.This game delivers the entire experience in a way Ive never quite seen.  Im new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games.  Here are the takeaways for me 1. Combat is extremely rewarding by being unforgiving.  At first glance, its hard, but as you delve just a little deeper you realize that combat in this game is an art form that takes practice, and then more practice.  The satisfaction is higher than any game Ive played in the last decade.  The light attacks, heavy attacks, blocks, parrying, sprint attacks, sneak attacks, all play a little different and allow you to really pick your method or avenue of approach.  2. Items in game from armor and weapons, to craftables and ashes are each, individually, potentially game changing or build changing and can really flesh out a build.  Its rewarding to find items in game as any one of them could be the weapon of choice for your desired build.  3. Open world is absolutely stunning and feels very scary, yet very exciting.  Every new enemy seen needs to be studied, practiced, and learned for optimal combat.  New enemies can be scary as you dont immediately know their capabilities.  Boss fights are hard some more than others and many enemies are the type that require you to come back at a later time when you have stronger tools, or more HP, or you git gud.  Roaming new areas is thrilling and you begin to truly have to balance and manage your HP, FP, and Stamina while in combat.  The lighting in caves with torches or lanterns is immersive and you feel the danger.4. Character building is straightforward.  You level up as you beat enemies and use the runes XP, currency as you see fit to either purchase things, or level up....etc and you can decide what attribute to increase.  Trying new weapons, new armors, is both fun and interesting.  The need to knows 1. Game wont hold your hand.  You are in a labyrinth with many things that all can kill you.  You will not know exactly what youre doing, where youre going, or why you are existing. 2. Everything you see can kill you if you become too careless.  Slow and steady usually is the best method.  Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.3. Ashes of War, summoning and crafting must be experimented with to understand.  Again, no hand holding.4. You will ask yourself, How in the world am I supposed to ever be able to complete this? Many, many times.5. Puzzles and secrets abound, exploration and a good memory are key.  6. While there is a multiplayer experience PVP and PVE its a bit confusing and from what Ive experienced so far, not necessarily mandatory.  The single player experience is strong with this one.Ive spent 42 hours in this game as of writing this and Ive barely left the starting area - Limgrave.  My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights.  Ive been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldnt change any of it.  I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi.  Its just a blast.  An absolute blast.  The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt.  You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience.  Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster youve gotten is a very rewarding experience. I have spent hours in both the base game and DLC. Here are my thoughts.I am in no way a hardcore player. This is the only game I have ever played by this company.  This game pissed me off so much because I didnt understand that is was out the box a difficult game.  I have since then completed 100 of the achievements and got through the DLC.  The DLC is rough but if you you just want to progress and beat bosses with ease, there are options.  Spirit summons, youtube cheese videos.  I enjoy exploring. I love the graphics and sometimes I want the challenge of a boss.  However I have completed the game made it enjoyable on my terms and dont care if I dont kill the boss without a summons.  I dont get paid to play games, so I take advantage of everything I can find and do in the game to go from point A to B.  I recommend the Base game and the DLC.  I looked at the DLC as how can I defeat and cheese the new bosses.  Not how do I learn the mechanics so people will know I am a good player.  I just dont care, I want to beat the game start to finish.  If I can do this and I am not a good player, then spend the money and beat it your way in anyway you see fit.

Let me start with the cons that outweigh the pros the open world feels empty, and it copies mobs from Dark Souls, even though this is a new universe and game. Its very difficult to follow the path planned by the developers because if you find the boss later, youll be too strong for him and will kill him on the first try. An open world is not suitable for this genre. The quests, as always in the games from this studio, are rubbish. In Dark Souls, they could be completed intuitively, but here, maybe 0.1 of players will finish them without guides. You practically need to get into Miyazakis head to figure out where the quest character is standing this time.There are few good bosses  8 come to mind, and its even funny to call the rest bosses. Theres a lack of a coherent local plot, and instead, we get more vague, global nonsense about gods and aliens.Now for the advantages of the game the beautiful locations, a sea of interesting weapons and spells, and the 8 good bosses. I especially liked the capital, though sadly, it was the only location that truly impressed me",
        "summary": "Opinion might change along the way as I am only half way, will update accordingly. This game feels like...walking out into Hyrule field after the Great Deku tree. First game in a long time where you get exactly what you payed for and exactly what was advertised."

        "text": "The game itself is great but dont buy the Deluxe EditionThe Adventure GuideArtworks wont come in pdfThe OST wont come in mp3 or flacThey will come as an .exeYou can extract the .mp3 one by one by opening the  .exe and selecting itIf you want to use the artworks as wallpaper you have to screenshot from the .exe, losing a lot of qualityNot worth 20 extra dollars Unfortunate i have to give everyone a big warning before buying the game. The game is not well optimised at least for the PC, and while the frame rate in enclosed areas is very stable, it will constantly stutter in open areas, from which the game will have many, since as the trailers show, you will even be able to ride on this big worldmap. Especially when a Boss makes a special move. Since Elden Ring is a game where you have to dodgereact to the opponents attacks in under a secound, this makes Bossfights frustrating beyond believe and honestly kinda unplayable at least in my eyes. I dont mind having to try a boss over and over because i make a mistake, but constantly dying, because the game freezes for 1 secound so i couldnt see which type of attack the boss is throwing at me is not the kind of challenge i am looking forward to. I hope that one of the first Patches will fix the horrible stutter problems that the game currently has, and i am really sure that once the problems are fixed, that the game will be absolutly amazing. But as for now, if you are still thinking if you should buy the game or not, i would highly recommend to wait for a while. 2 years later and this game still has stuttering issues, is still locked at a 169 aspect ratio, and still has an awful anti-cheat systemA great game that is hampered by a poor port As an avid souls-borne player, I really tried and gave this game my all. I wanted to like it so badly, but I cant bring myself to even complete a second play-through. This review will contain spoilers so I advise skipping this review unless you have thoroughly completed the game.Firstly, Id like to start off with the great things this game doesBetter Melee Variety I love how there are different viable attacks when fighting with melee weapons, ashes of war while some are quite busted, is a great mechanic to shake up monotonous melee combat. I love that charged strong attacks, and jumping attacks are not only viable, but some of the strongest attacks you can do. I love how shields can be altered and tweaked to match your build wonderfully, and how useful they feel when performing guard breaks.World Design  Aesthetics This game, while being a souls-like, does an amazing job at separating itself from the look of the other souls games. The high-fantasy themes really show through in this games most beautiful areas. Even enemies and bosses themselves look amazing. This game easily has the best visuals, aesthetics, and design out of all of fromsoftwares current titles.Exploration, Sense of Scale, Level Design This game feels massive with so many different things you can do, and so many enemies to fight. The legacy dungeons are all so fun to explore, and make for some of the most classic souls-borne gameplay.Now on to the cons I have with the gameBoss  Enemy Design Truly the most upsetting thing about this game for me. The simplest way to sum up this issue is that it feels as if your character in Elden Ring is from Dark Souls 1, and the enemies are ported from Dark Souls 3. I really have no issues with bosses having never-ending combos of attacks, granted that I have the equal and opposite ability to properly react and evade. The combat in Elden Ring often feels challenging in the wrong way. Bosses more often than not have combos that never seem to end, and also an apparent fetish for aoe moves. I also find the bosses enjoy falling into a loop of repeating moves time and time again, spamming the same moves until your corpse is butchered to a pulp. My character ended the game with 60 Vitality, and it still felt like I never had enough hp. Armour seems to have little to no purpose, as I have to invest in endurance and sacrifice one trinket slot to have a dollar tree version of Havels Ring in order to wear armour that feels no stronger than paper mache. The amount of repeated bosses in this game is really disheartening. After exploring catacomb 59 and finding the misbegotten warrior and another trash mob in an arena, the sense to explore is a fleeting feeling. It is tragic, and feels horribly lazy and under-cooked. No other fight drives this point home better than the Godskin Duo. If youve been playing the game to the highest extent, then youve fought these enemies multiple times Caelid Tower, the Witches Village, Volcano Manor, etc. Already, youve seen these bosses far too many times to count. However, the creme de la creme is awaiting you at the Crumbling Faram Azura where you have to fight them for one last hurrah, both at the same time. This is an essential fight you need to do to beat the game. I really implore anyone that avidly enjoys this game, what was the purpose of putting this fight there? I find myself asking this question far often than I should when I encounter a reused boss in an area that didnt need a boss.It seems that a major strategy of Elden Ring is to avoid engaging with the boss, most if not every challenging boss follows this same logic. Fighting Radhan? Just hit him a couple times stage one then spam the summons second stage and never attack him directly. Fighting Melania? Just stun-lock her and use mimic tear to take aggro off you so when she uses her 1000 hit combo the fight just doesnt abruptly end. The list goes on with people listing just use bleed, bloody slash, use magic, use x ash of war and spam it until theyre dead, use the rotten stray and proc scarlet rot, insert exploit here. None of these are proper solutions. Did you feel a sense of accomplishment when you bloody slashed the 27th boss to death? Did you feel satisfied when your mimic tear summon soloed the boss? Did you have fun watching scarlet rot tick down that boss youve been struggling to beat? You shouldnt have to re-spec to fight certain bosses, every fight should have viable solutions and a sense that every play-style has a chance to win. Whether that chance be low, or high, it should always feel possible, and it shouldnt feel like the odds are so stacked against you that you have to make do and essentially exploit the game to continue on.This entire game comes to a climax inside the Erd Tree, in easily the most disappointing final boss in all of souls. I still remember the first time I fought Gwyn, Gherman, and the Soul of Cinder. Each of these games built up their final fights so immensely well, it was a challenge I was overjoyed with. Walking through the fog gate into Gwyns boss room is a feeling I will never feel again. The dread, knowing that everything that Ive accomplished has come to this final moment, and when I win, I can finally fulfil the prophecy foretold to me. I felt nothing when I got to the Elden Beast. I felt no sense of accomplishment, no joy, no fear, no happiness... just nothing. It felt like nothing had led up to that point, there was no build-up, no emotion, no struggle, no sense of accomplishment. Just a gauntlet of two mediocre bosses back to back.I really tried to enjoy this game, I really did, but the boss design in this game really brings it down many pegs for me, and kills all replay-ability this game ever could have. If you enjoyed this game, Im happy for you, but I just want to voice my feelings for others that may have felt the same way. If you didnt like the game, thats ok! If you did, Im happy you enjoyed it and could see past the things I took issue with.Overall, as a souls-like, this game simply does not do it for me, and maybe others may share my feelings as well. Do not buy this game right now on PC, do not give them your money until they put in the effort to make a functioning PC port.I love FromSoft games, have for many years but the PC ports are always neglected. This time though not only a 60 FPS cap but also extremely poor performance and stuttering in fights, and very frequently in the open world. Sometimes they can last a second or longer becoming extremely frustrating. Walking around stuttering is frequent, my CPU is running at 4.8Ghz regularly on one core and yet and most of the other cores are sleeping, GPU usage is only 40 or so and Ive tried lowering settings but to no avail. I have a Radeon 6800XT, 5900X, 32GB 3733 MTs CL 16 RAM with an NVMe drive running the latest 22.2.3 drivers and it runs extremely well in other AAA titles. This level of performance is infuriating, and quite frankly makes the game unplayable. I will likely be refunding the game if this is not resolved soon. Im not even the only one experiencing these issues, so Im pretty sure its not my hardware.httpsm.twitch.tvcohhcarnageclipNastyPrettyAlmondPipeHype-ih1OrBYVEOwP17N2Digital Foundry has done a full piece on some of these issues, which many people have much worse httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v5EtcrUrsl38 Your anti cheat system does not allow me, a disabled individual with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2 and only limited use of my right hand, to be able to play using my onscreen keyboard to do the actions required so right now I cannot play the game because of this issue.  It looks like a really awesome game, but as of right now I cannot recommend the game because I am unable to play.  In the future if this is fixed I will change my answer to yes. Just to lay down my bonafides, since every negative review here is instantly spammed with git gud or some cringe 2011-type beat Ive 100ed every Dark Souls game. Ive done speedruns, challenge runs, the whole lot. When I call things in Elden Ring hard, it is NOT for lack of experience.Elden Ring has a lot of minor flaws sparse armor early game, some jank w teleporting field bosses, boring crafting, boring catacombs, the hundreds of spirits and flowers I will NEVER use, but I can basically forgive all of those, because the game at the start is honestly incredible.However... about halfway through, the development budget totally falls out, and every area is now a ten-mile corridor full of enemies that can 2-shot you alone. The placement feels almost random at times, and it gets tilting fast. There is an entire lategame subcontinent with three graces. That means, if you die to any of the 2-shotting wolves or patrolling archer hordes, you have to cross the entire thing again. The two areas after that are nearly as bad, to the point that sprinting through is the only viable option.Once again, I can totally forgive some bad levels! Every game has some... but the larger bosses feel like pulling teeth.Trying to beat every shardbearer major boss, youll find at least two that are literally unplayable. One early game that is easily cheesable,  Starscourge Radahn, and one lategame that is entirely unforgiveable,  Malenia, Blade of Miquella. The latter has an attack that is almost entirely undodgeable, with a half-second tell that only helps if youre 30 feet away, and takes me from 1500 to 0 in a second. After all the shardbearers, you get the semifinal boss, a damage sponge who can 1 or 2-shot with every attack, who has an entire phase where every attack is a room-filling AOE, and who then phases into a grab machine that will instakill you with its comical grab hitboxes and 12-attack combos.If you can beat the AOEGrab-machine, you get the honor of fighting the final boss... which has a fun-if-unfairish first phase, followed up by a ridiculous final phase full of camera-breaking nonsense and a very childlike idea of Cool Final Boss, which singlehandedly ruined my belief that the writers had ANY plan for this endgame. Like,  we had a cool final boss in phase one with Radagon, but they got swapped for the idea of the elden ring like a ridiculous Soul of Cinder parody. Once the comical, humiliating damage sponge is taken care of, you get your pick of ending! There are effectively two, with one obviously bad third choice where  you literally burn the entire world, because why not,  and overall, we leave with very little idea what any of this was about, what our ending choice even means for the world, or what weve really done in the first place. Yay! Game done! After 90 hours, I feel totally numb and ambivalent to this!There are a lot more things to talk about, like how finnicky quests become with an open world, but fuck. I think the worst thing I can say is that I spent all of Elden Ring planning new runs and build ideas, and now that Ive beaten it... I just feel tired... and let down. But the OST does 100 slap, and I do love Torrent, as well as a lot of the NPCs. 100 A for them, you can hug a woman, which is more than I can say about my love life---EDIT There is actually precisely ONE thing from the comments Id like to add to this review. If you see anyone saying Elden Ring has six endings, let me break them down for you.There is the basic ending. There is the true-ish ending. There is a bad ending. Then, there are three more endings. These are all the basic ending with a color filter over the cutscene and a single word of dialogue changed. Nothing new is added, and they amount to Become god, become god but bad grey, become god but VERY bad red, and become god but catholic. These feel like extremely late additions, and they only highlight how vapid the difference in non-apocalyptic endings really is. Theyre meaningless enough that Elden Ring basically only has three endings.Also, I only learned after writing this that the game features a field boss who is literally the first shardbearer! The dude from all the trailers just... shows up in the field with a different name, and you fight him again. Elden Rings copypasting problem is seriously everpresent, and Ive not touched on it as much as it deserves, especially considering how mandatory catacombs are to the game. Its fun for one run, but by the second playthrough, Id really prefer if spirit tuning components were just distributed throughout the fun parts of the game. stuttering like crazy no matter what settings its atedit thanks for the free points i used on nekopara backgrounds Game is extremely good however, wait for awhile if planning to play on PC. Major optimization issues. Best summary for this game the more you play it, the less youll like it.Elden Ring starts off as a superb, engaging exploration of a wide world with many fixed encounters that you learn to navigate and overcome. But eventually, overcoming challenges only means finding one of the various cheesy weapons and spells available, and spamming the hell out of it. This issue overflows in PvP where despite a wealth of equipment available, you will always face off against opponents using the same few strategies. Because cheesing is encouraged by the core mechanics of the game, and doing anything else becomes increasingly drawn out and frustrating, youll burn out and some point and start outright skipping normal PvE encounters because they arent worth the time and resources they take you to defeat, and you just dont care anymore. Ive played every Souls game before and, while each had a shitty level here and there, it never felt generalized like that.Elden Ring seems to be lacking this unique quality present in previous Souls game where you could do fairly well with any equipment that you felt comfortable with, both in PvE and PvP. It may be because some Ashes of War and spells are simply too good, too spammable in this game, while previously you mostly relied on basic attacks and movement no matter the weapon special moves were there but didnt take center stage. Enemies didnt need to be so numerous and spongy, PvP didnt need to be a cheesefest the few offending weapons were patched and many people who beat you were actually good and deserved it.Im still gonna play Elden Ring for a while, but I think their design decisions are such that this drawn-out, cheese-to-win design is irreversible and wont be mended until their next game. It is because because I know that From Software can do better, that I am posting this negative review. Feel free to play and see for yourself! Im a 65-yr-old who grew up with RPGs in the 80s and 90s, and TES. LOVED those, and play them over and over. ER is not my kind of game cant save wherever I like, and fighting is too much like actionarcade. Id probably be okay if the difficulty level could be lowered to Old Codger. Okay, I hear you laughing at me way in the back.... As for me, I wont be returning, and the ring remains shattered. As will my ego. Ill look for a game called, Elder Ring or Reflexes-Are-Really-Rusty Ring. I know many will handwave away any criticisms of this game as salt or reply with git gud, but as a fan of Fromsoft games since Demons Souls, this game has felt like the most punitive and least satisfying of the games. While the setting is undoubtedly beautiful and there is a fascinating story and interesting characters, the design philosophy of this game is especially punishing. To put it mildly, this game feels as if the character has the moveset of Dark Souls 3 with the additions of Counter guards and jumping attacks while the enemies have the moveset of Bloodborne foes and the tracking of Sekiro enemies. Foes in this game are more punishing than ever with delayed attacks, enhanced tracking, and better AI. While this works, it feels like a bit too much in some instances. It feels like almost every enemy has some 2880-degree combo spin move, giant Area of Effect explosion, or some mix of both. In addition to these challenging attacks to deal with, enemy attacks are harder to read than ever, with many different combos having the same start-up or coming out incredibly fast. While this may be a product of the performance issues of the PC Port, some enemies feel as if they are fighting with a lag switch even if the game is not dropping frames or otherwise functioning normally. I have had numerous occasions where torrent your trusty steed will suddenly drop dead seemingly out of nowhere or instances where enemy health bars will strangely refill or moments where I will seemingly be dead angled by attacks hitting me head-on. These factors are compounded by the damage enemies can do. It is not uncommon to see some field bosses or more challenging opponents doing 900 damage in an attack which is a death sentence for numerous characters, especially when these attacks are also fast swinging and usually accompanied by area of effect damage. Simultaneously the game feels very starved when it comes to runes. While numerous rune farming areas have been discovered, it is surprisingly disproportionate regarding difficulty and the number of runes enemies drop. Some of the easiest foes in the game that can easily be stunlocked and killed without difficulty will drop over 1000 runes. Meanwhile, literal giants that can, on occasion, pose a threat drop similar rates of runes. It feels bizarre and unrewarding to see genuinely challenging regular foes drop so few runes instead of the commonly farmed areas. Speaking of being unrewarding, while this is probably a personal problem, I do not feel accomplished from defeating bosses in this game. I remember the hype of beating Ornstein and Smough, Gehrman, Pontiff Sulyvahn, and Isshin, the Sword Saint. When I power through and defeat a challenging boss in Elden Ring, I feel annoyed. Despite some of these bosses taking all of my skill and ability to beat a boss in Elden Ring, I do not feel the same excitement I did in previous games. I do not feel like I have accomplished something. It just feels frustrating. I am not entirely sure what causes this, but the game does not feel rewarding. Still, I will continue to play, and I will beat it. Perhaps once that is done, I will update my review and give a final score. However, this has been the least enjoyable of the Fromsoft games I have played for now. If you personally enjoy it, that is great and more power to you, but I have found the game unrewarding, annoying, and far more draining than any previous games. Rather than being left with a sense of accomplishment after clearing any milestone in the game, I remain left with a feeling of annoyance as if I have completed a tiresome chore rather than an epic boss battle. Update It is a shame I am not playing Salt and Sanctuary, for this review has been a lucrative salt mine.Update 2 It appears this review has gotten quite a few responses! Welcome! As mentioned before, I will finish this game. Sunk cost fallacy or not, I paid for it, and I am far too deep to refund it now. As of the writing of this update, I am currently a level 90 pure strength build I abandoned my original level 60 character after feeling like I had hit a wall with a two-handed quality build. At the moment, this character has hit a bit of a wall with Commander Niall. If this information helps with your headcannon about me, you are welcome!Update 3Final Thoughts Now that I have become Elden Lord, I still stand by most of what I have said. While there are moments of the game I genuinely enjoy, bosses such as the Fire Giant and the Godskin Duo are pretty emblematic of this games boss design and philosophy. Tedious, frustrating, and more of a chore than something that can give actual hype. While there are genuinely great bosses that can get one hyped up and good early open-world design that allows the player to roam around without being walled off, I think many of the bosses feel less like a test of skill and more like a war of attrition, a war that you can lose highly quickly. However, it is a war I ultimately won, a feat that, at the time of this being typed, .8 of players on steam have achieved. I abandoned my first character after over 20 hours of gameplay and managed to beat it at level 110 in a little over 34 hours after some experimenting. There are good elements of this game, the world is beautiful, the fashion souls are as great as ever, and the customization has been taken to the next level. At the same time, though, the boss design is, in my opinion, some of the worst it has ever been. Simultaneously, there are many reused bosses and enemies, even for a Fromsoft andor open-world game. This has always been the case in Fromsoft games, but this goes beyond even the Dark Souls 2 Pursuer level of reuse. There is good here in the game and moments of hype and excitement. However, it feels especially punishing for certain builds and playstyles at the same time. You dont need to git gud to beat many of these bosses if you ask me. If you check in on any guide, the answer seems to be most of the time, you simply need to git bleed or perhaps git spells.Update 4 seamless co-op mod Since I first played this game until now, Elden Ring has had several significant patches and quite a few changes real ones will know the pain of 1.0 Radahn. However, with the advent of mods, especially the seamless co-op mod, the game is substantially more fun. The co-op has been a saving grace of many Souls games, not necessarily because of how it can make things easier but also the fun community shenanigans that can occur. While I still think that, on its own, this is probably the weakest entry in Froms current line-up, the waves of patches that came in have made the game decisively better, and, furthermore, the seamless co-op mod has allowed something genuinely magical to come about. The game is substantially more fun and a lot more wondrous, in my opinion having a constant companion to play it with FAQQA Did you try to adapt to Elden Ring mechanics?Yes! I used consumables, the mimic tear ashes which is borderline mandatory in some bosses, jumping attacks, Torrent, followed the advice of seemingly everyone on the planet and got a bleed weapon, and I even dipped into faith to take a helpful incantation. These items can certainly make certain bosses more manageable especially bleeding. Since we are getting to the point where bosses regularly have over 25,000 HP, max HP damage feels more and more mandatory to make the game feel more playable. Will you continue to play the game?I might. I am thinking about maybe playing a character that focuses more on incantations or sorceries. I also desire to help struggling players against bosses I have beaten and be a friendly summon that can hopefully make their game less frustrating. To be honest, this is the only real grinding that I enjoy. No Maidens? I rushed through the game from a story standpoint, not an exploration standpoint, so I did sacrifice her to become Elden Lord. I had to vote it down because Bandai decided to increase the prices of all their games in poor countries by 6 times.Now, the games cost in my country more than a 10 days average wage. What a shame!!! after 170 hours a hacker invades my world and puts my account in a permanent death loop. GOODBYE 170 of progress. UPDATE After patch 1.03.2 my character is still stuck in the loop. After contacting support, the answer I got was Sadly, I cannot guarantee this will be resolved through a patch or an update. I recommend you create a new character if you wish to play the game.  So pretty much pound sand to everyone effected. It doesnt matter what I think of Elden Ring.This game sold over 20 million copies in a year. In the era of games as live service, it demonstrated that an incredibly difficult single-player experience can be a blockbuster. Its Fromsofts biggest hit and has cemented them as one of the most iconic developers of all time. The world has spoken - this game is great. The fact that I didnt like it very much is totally irrelevant. But I value honesty in review, and in this case being honest means going against the grain. Thats kind of daunting as a reviewer - who among you is brave enough to critique the Mona Lisa, or Taylor Swifts latest album? These sorts of juggernauts are hard to approach, but Ive summoned up my courage, and Im ready to be a contrarian.My first complaint is the switch to open world. The Dark Souls games are a series of branching corridors, with paths opening or closing dynamically. Theres a real sense of momentum pushing you forward from bonfire to bonfire, delving ever deeper into your own personal quest. It sets a mood both claustrophobic and expansive.Elden Ring, by contrast, feels too large. Simply following the critical path will get you maimed, so youre encouraged to spend a lot of time justwandering around the landscape. Its a beautiful landscape to be sure, but theres altogether too little happening in most of it. Liurnia in particular is a dull slog, but all of the areas suffer from a design that emphasizes scenery over a sense of flow.Speaking of a sense of flow, bosses also feel like a downgrade from previous titles. The core of the combat in these games is learning the attack patterns of your opponents. Starting with Sekiro, the design became a bit more meta as we predict the bosses, the designers predict us right back. Things like, to use examples from the game, a stomp attack having a little leg hitch to draw out the animation unexpectedly, or a sword swing that is actually a bluff for a downward slam.These little bait animations ruin the fun. Dark Souls felt good because the demon lifted his club to strike, you guessed the timing, and the demon missed you. Elden Ring, by contrast, will make the timing janky just to catch you. It moves the combat away from visual prediction and towards rote memorization, which lessens it. All of this could be easily forgiven if the story was gripping, and I was very optimistic on this front, considering George R.R Martins involvement. Sadly, the story is garbage, told poorly - and you know this to be true, because you watched a Youtube video in order to understand it, rather than go through the torture of trying to learn the lore through gameplay. Understanding the story is hours of disjointed investigative work, struggling through side quests that become uncompletable at a slight breeze and reading item descriptions for insufferably vague context clues. If it wasnt for VaatiVidya and his ilk, wed all be completely lost - thats simply poor storytelling.It all felt like vague allusion for the sake of vague allusion. So much was left open to interpretation that the line between loose end and plot hole feels very blurred, which fundamentally weakens the narrative. Nobodys motives are explicable and thus nobodys motives are interesting. Elden Ring honestly just feels like a Dark Souls knock-off. One could argue that Bloodborne and Sekiro were the same, but to me, they felt like interesting and compelling innovations on the core mechanics established in Demon Souls. Elden Ring didnt innovate. It just slapped on a coat of paint, went open world, and called it a day. Souls became Grace, Lords of Cinder became Rune Bearers, and mechanics were almost entirely rehashed from old titles. Boring!Ultimately, none of my complaints are important. 20 million copies, remember? This review is going to get drowned out by positive reviews from people who had a great 150 hours with this game, and honestly, thats probably for the best. Theres clearly something really special here that a lot of people love, and that should be celebrated. But as a FromSoft fan, as an RPG fan, and as a fan of challenging combat games in general, I was left disappointed by Elden Ring. Quick summary first Ive played every game from Fromsoft starting with dark souls and I view BB as the best, I have roughly 1400 hours across the series and have done everything in this game. Elden Ring fails as a souls game and it is with this opinion I would not recommend, despite that it could be a great open-world game. it has fantastic visuals and the world is interesting sometimes but it has awful repetitive bosses, copy-pasted enemies with different coats of paint, zero direction for the player, a useless crafting system and unrewarding exploration.The story is easily missable as the exposition dump character only appears at certain graces and only if you notice the talk to her button appeared. I normally dont have an issue with the story in these games as the environment and item descriptions do the telling but not knowing why I need to become the Elden lord or how the world got the way it did kinda sapped my motivation which consisted of exploring and find a new thing. From what I can tell its the same thing as dark souls with fire being integral, big trees, and really boring naming convention Eld, Erd, every name starts with a goddamn M. Seriously we have Marika, Mohg, Mohgwyn, Malenia, Melina, Miquela, Millicent, Miriel and runes instead of souls.Not having a scooby where to go is par for the course with the series but is exponentially worse with the open-world as the graces only point towards the nearest lord, not the medallion you might need, some legacy dungeons are horrific Stormveil comes to mind, I couldnt imagine being a new player and experiencing that fresh hell as the game encourages you to go there first instead of the nice southern area to get 3 tears, having three secret areas within itself is some dumb design the consecrated snowfields, the Haligtree and the blood area can be missed despite the fact they each hold one of the lord bosses that drops a great rune.The reward for exploring is pitiful see that item behind the illusionary wall and protected by a hard mob? Its a crafting flower that has an infinite respawn area. You just killed a hard boss? Useless ash summon for you. 90 of the armour I had was farmed by enemies or bought from merchants.I honestly think dark souls 2 has a better enemy variety which was lambasted as dudes in armour, in this game when I go to a different area it is the exact same knights and footsoldiers in different coloured armour and composition of allies. I get that some enemies have to be reused but seriously I should not see them in every area, oh and some reskinned mobs from previous games make a visit like the demi-humans are reskinned monkeys from Sekiro.The world looks phenomenal especially the underground environments like Nokron despite some goofy stuff that might be a reference but takes me out of it like the Nights Cavalry aka Nazgul, Godfrey Joestar, Blaidd who is literally guts.The crafting system brings nothing of value to the formula, I think I crafted one stack of arrows and an item discovery boost as arrows can be bought and are of better quality, buildup resist items were never necessary, firebombs and the myriad of variants were borderline useless as hitting the thing with a stick is quicker and less likely to get you punished for missing. Usable items only challenge runs should be more interesting now.The bosses are horrific, there are multiple slightly beefed up mobs with a health bar and name, gank fights happen too often to artificially pump up the difficulty, some bosses are too big for their arenas so you fight the camera tree spirits suck, some can fly so high you cant see them so dragons consist of please dive bomb me, dont breathe fire. Most unique bosses have fast high damage attacks, glue-like tracking, multiple distance closing attacks, most standard attacks have AOE effects think twin princes overhead from DS3 or Lawrence from BB, some form of delayed attack like the nameless king. Now can you see the issue? Bosses went from most of the time playing on similar rules as the player as big weapon  long reach  big damage - slow even Bloodborne to a lesser extent understood this like Ludwig, AOE attacks used to be limited to 1 attack that had an easy tell, a fast backhand attack would do little damage but now borderline one taps even if you overleveled vigour. Not a single boss was enjoyable no memorable greats like OS, Artorias, Gwyn, Maria or Friede, Gael, Soul of Cinder, Genchiro, Fume Knight, Ludwig. I went through this game praying for a good boss and the closest I got was Malenia who while fast and stupidly hard-hitting felt fair until she spammed one bs attack, killing her was pure luck that she never used that move. Every other souls game I looked forward to the next boss and learning the fight like a dance, now it was sheer dread as to what flavour of Lawrence will kill me this time? With Bloodborne being my favourite game high speed gameplay is what I love but this game suffers for it as you dont have the mobility to keep up with the bosses.Apparently, the optimisation is also rubbish worked fine with me but your mileage may vary.This game was not meant for solo players it was very clearly designed around co-op and spamming ash summons which goes against everything I knew about the series. I honestly do not want to play it again unlike the others where I was excited for NG. Now because I went against the almighty Miyazaki I expect to see a shill in the comments hitting me with git gud or you have x hours how can you not recommend please do not disappoint me. A Connection Error Has Occurred. Returning You To Your World. Elden Ring is a good game. Perhaps the best game FromSoft has made, give or take Sekiro. There are a lot of people who are going to play it and love it. Unfortunately, there are also those who will read the ridiculous aggregate reviews--rife with some unseasonably lofty claims--and forget that this is, absolutely, a FromSoft game. I came into Elden Ring as someone who has never really enjoyed FromSoft games, hopeful that this would be the one that finally snags me. I mean, look at the reviews, right? Despite my distaste for the sub-genre, Ive played and beaten each game at least once for reasons more to do with social circles than aught else, so I feel like I have experienced enough of FromSofts content to be well-versed in how each game flows. I was thus expecting Elden Ring and its open world to be the major shake-up the series gameplay desperately needed in my opinion.Sadly, this was not the case. Essentially, in place of an engaging, rich open world, I found a Dark Souls themepark its vast and overflowing with Dark Souls things you can do. Everywhere you look! Dark Souls! Under that rock. In that cave. Look at that castle on the hill--guess whats in it? Thats right Dark Souls. If you like Dark Souls, you are going to have an absolute blast. Elden Ring is an incredible, unforgettable Dark Souls experience. In fact, for you, this review should not be taken as a negative but as an overwhelming positive.That said, if, like me, you have not historically enjoyed Dark Souls? Dont expect there to be much gameplay left beyond that classic loop to make up for it. Elden Ring is a Dark Souls game through and through. The rooms are just wider.Edit Horse is pretty cool tho. Is sad but the optimization of this game is very poor. Stuttering, slowdowns and fps drop everysingle move you make...O dear from software what did you done here? Performance FIx to Gain FPS and Stability- Disable Easy Anti Cheat!httpswww.windowscentral.comhow-disable-anti-cheat-elden-ringEpic is probably bitter Elden Ring is not sold on their platform so they sabotaged it. lol- Turn of your internet while playing,Crazy but true. Somehow the online portion eats up tons of resources. Maybe some sort of spying software is running.- Did all the tweaks in this video.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vLXTrZDQDjtoI cant run the game at 1080p 60 before even on the lowest settings. But with this tweaks. I can now run the game at 1440P 60 high and some max settings.Still wont recommend as doing this method cuts you out of the online mode of the game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance is super poor. Stuttering a lot cause of inconsistent frames and world loading constantly.Some particle effects takes a huge hit on FPS as well.FPS is also poor in the open world area. 40-45 FPS on 1080p all low settings GTX 1080 with trees flickering and pop ins.Game does not even look that good even on the max settings. Do not know why it needs that much resource, maybe a deal from card makers? We dont know.They should have added FSR to alleviate this FPS issue, but hey they probably will sell more cards without it.Similar open world games like Assassins Creed Odyssey, Phantom Pain, Death Stranding, etc.. etc.. Works flawlessly on release and looked better as well with tons more goinf on in them. FromSoft games always has this issues. but hey, they will fix them later right?Can not rebind separately sprint and dodge. Walk button is also always forgotten in this types of console port.Also auto center wont ever have a toggle to turn off in this type of ports as well.Fans will still defend this game to no end and its us who is at fault and not the devs that have been babied by these fans for years. That is why this is happening constantly on every release of their games. They will never learn because they are being enabled by this fans.Maybe that is why reviewers leaves this stuff out or just sets it aside as they dont want any backlash from the tons of fans this game has, which to them the game does no wrong and so apologetic about this issues or just blame the victims.",
        "summary": "This game easily has the best visuals, aesthetics, and design out of all of fromsoftwares current titles. The game is not well optimised at least for the PC, and while the frame rate in enclosed areas is very stable, it will constantly stutter in open areas. This review will contain spoilers so I advise skipping this review unless you have thoroughly completed the game. As an avid souls-borne player, I really tried and gave this game my all."

Thanks Larian Studios! You guys are the best! Theres no way anyone actually reads this review among the thousands of others, but I had such a good time with this game I wanted to contribute my 0.0001 to whatever the positive review proportion stands at.Its good! FOR ALL THE DEVS THAT HAVE MICRO-TRANSACTIONS ETCYou know your doing something right when other developers like EAUbisoftBlizzard, etc, come out saying, Baldurs Gate 3 should not be the new standard. To put it simply, they are just mad because Larian Studios will not have a battle-pass, micro-transactions and expensive DLCs.Which after all, is all us gamers want. Just a polished game with unlimited hours of fun. Well done Larian Studios! You can tell you actually care about games, and have bought back what it felt like 15 years ago for me.EDITreading through the comments and you can see the majority rules. when i speak of DLCs im referring to things that should already of been included in the base game for example, Total War Warhammer great game btw should, in my opinion, already include the chaos race in the base game. i shouldnt have to pay an extra 30 for this particular race, once again just my opinion. now id happily pay for an expensive DLCadd-on whatever you want to call it for BG3, especially if its the same quality as Blood and Wine.Narrator you sense something staring at you from afar, something pulls your gaze from the screen and, as you slowly turn your head your good eye catches the time. your gaze is now drawn to your wife Raphael as you realise you have been playing for almost 8 hours straight.1. give in to the tadpole and go mow the lawns 2. INTELLIGENCE broker a deal with the wife to continue playing3. PALADIN it is by your oath that you will push through whatever evil stands in your way and continue4. fk its almost time for work.... Its like playing DD in real life except your players dont cancel last minute Within the last 2 hours of game time Ive managed toSeduce an OgreStart a civil warReceive brain surgery from a poetEat several dozen brain wormsKiss a lizardNow if youll excuse me I need to get back to the game. The experience playing this game is like eating a medium-rare steak after years of eating out of dumpsters. 60 dollars for a microtransaction free, battle pass free, subscription free, non-live service game in the year of our lord 2023. . . Wild. This game is amazing, deserved game of the year 110.And the actor of Astarion deserved his award aswell but i would want to give award to everyone behind this masterpiece of a game. A game that def is worth the money a true AAAA title. Support Larian. Buy this game if you havent. Buy it right now and buy the deluxe version. Also buy it for your PS5.Ignore stupid companies and devs saying oh, this shouldnt be a new standard for RPG going forward.BG3 is the kind of game we, players have been waiting for so long.NO MICRO-TRANSACTION, no half-cooked trash, FUN AND ENJOYABLE GAME. We consumers decide what the new standard is. If your game is good, we buy and we play. Dont tell us what to think and what to play.SUPPORT LARIAN. This is how you show up devs like Ubisoft with no imagination.This is how you show up devs like EA who love their loot boxesThis is how you show up devs like Blizzard with season passes and real money shopsThis is how you show up every dev demanding online connections for single player gamesThis is how you create a game  that ticks the type of boxes fans want tickedThis is giving you a complete game for your moneyThis is giving you a quality experienceThis is delivering what was promisedThis is Larian.Thank you for Baldurs Gate 3End of turn, waiting for other devs to roll a 20 Divinity Original Sin was a good game. Divinity Original Sin 2 was, in my opinion, the best top down RPG ever made at that point Im 72 and I have played a bunch of them. Baldurs Gate 3 is looking even more complex, has better graphics, better cut scenes, deeper interpersonal interactions and a better story line than Divinity Original Sin 2. L. Studios keeps improving. I have never paid for a Beta game before but I trusted that this game would be finished and I am certain that it will. Sans the understandable crashes, gliches and freezes, this game is truly fun to play even though it is not finished. After finishing the game i just uninstalled every other game on my PC because i couldnt bear the thought of having trash like League of Legends installed on the same machine as this masterpiece.EditFixed typos This game returned a piece of me that I hadnt felt in a long time. It gave me so much comfort. When Im sad Ill load this game up and lose myself in it. I could sit there for days, play it, and not leave my room. Its given me a beautiful story full of characters written with so much care and detail, characters who have felt the same things I have, love, joy, abandonment, betrayal, hope, and so on. The endless possibilities, finding new things every run, seeing how beautiful this game really is. Ive never felt so connected to any game before, and I dont think I ever will. Im not a gamer, but i like this game, i can play on easy mode and just relax and have fun This is absolutely my GOTY. One of the best CRPGs of all time, perhaps the best mainstream CRPG ever made. My playtime is real minus the 12 hours I spent in EA, so you can see the game is HUGE. And all that playtime is filled to the brim with well-executed content.So if you like RPGs, tactics, huge adventures, and bears, the game is a must-buy. Its not a question. The only real question is is Baldurs Gate 3 a 97100?Short answer Act 1 absolutely is. And Act 1 took me 56 hours. If the game only consisted of Act 1 with some sort of ending, it would already have been brilliant. Think about it less than one third of Baldurs Gate 3 is already a better game than most other CRPGs on the market. How is it even possible?Later, however, it starts to crumble under its own weight  and I dont just mean the bugs. Those will be fixed the meaninglessness of many final choices and lack of companion interaction likely wont. And its a damn shame.GAMEPLAYLarian RPGs arent simply RPGs, they border isometric immersive sims, and its a great concept, brilliantly executed here. You have your ordinary RPG fare classes, abilities, XP, lockpicking, traps. And then you have a simulated world that you can interact with in creative and sensible ways. Cant pick a chest? Just take it away to open in camp. A boss is too tough? Surround him with explosive barrels pre-encounter and blow to smithereens. Or befriend him  you can side and kill any faction in the game. Cant reach someplace? Aside from various teleportation spells, you can also just carry a bunch of boxes to build a tower wherever you need.Traversal is a separate and unique  feature of the game. Most CRPGs are flat, apart from terrain in some battlefields, sometimes. Larian uses the Z axis to its full extent. Baldurs Gate 3 has interesting jumping puzzles what right does a CRPG even have to have those?. Some of its areas, like the Monastery, feel like legacy dungeons from a FromSoft game, and I mean it in the best way possible. Theyre fun to explore and find routes through, secrets in. Its a game as much about exploration as it is about story and combat.Not to mention that it uses verticality for spectacular visual impressions in some areas.Another critical aspect of Baldurs Gate 3s exploration is just how dense it is. Even the emptier areas are packed with content. You find characters, secrets, reactivity, small stories. Figuring out a secret sometimes requires unique interactions, like reading a scroll in a certain location or casting a specific spell. Its brilliant, and fun, and the best aspect of the game by far. No other product on the market offers anything remotely comparable.STORYIts hit and miss.Id put it this way in this game, Acting  Characters  Story. Baldurs Gate 3 is incredibly well-acted, I cant remember a single character, even minor, that would be presented as anything less than good, and most main characters are just charisma personified  to the point where I was disappointed I couldnt have more interactions with someone like Ketheric. So whenever a character arc struggles a bit being too cliche or too melodramatic, the acting makes up for it. And since most characters are interesting enough, their personal stories make up for the less brilliant part of the overall narrative. So in the end, it works. Writing has never been Larians strongest suit. Since you can befriend or kill any character in the game, their writing in Divinity tended to be skin-deep and its definitely MUCH better here. So thats progress.The tone of Baldurs Gate 3 would probably not be for everyone. It rarely takes itself too seriously and its at its best when it doesnt. The small comedic storylets like with the smart orge and characters like Minsc just ooze charm. The erotic scenes are honesly very cool  if, again, you dont take yourself too seriously. With many of them, youre not meant to.Its also very black-and-white, almost outdated in this regard. You can absolutely have an evil playthrough, but do understand that evil means cackling sadistic evil that enjoys splattering squirrels and forcing people to kill themselves with their own daggers in front of you. Good and evil are objective qualities here and there is no grey area, no attempt at deconstruction. Its all fun if you go with it just keep it in mind.The games pacing is also great. You need to rest from time to time, usually after harder fights. And most long rests launch cutscenes that explore one story or another of your party members, weird urges, or mysterious Guardian. Companions also have a LOT of reactivity and interjections in random events. Its all mixed up to create a very natufal flow. I dont think a lot of players even notice it  rare occasions of unique reactivily like characters having reactions to having been killed and resurrected by you are flashier. But dont underrate the importance of overall pacing. Pacing can make or break a game.SO WHAT IS WRONG HERE?Act 1 is absolutely brilliant and one of the best games Ive ever played.Act 2 makes some odd choices, but at least theyre clearly artistic. After a dense location filled to the brim with content and reactivity, you find yourself in a huge open area with trash mob ambushes. I appreciate the Bloodborne-esque aesthetics as much as the next gal, but why does the game willingly forefit its best assets the interesting secret-packed exploration, the reactivity, the interlocking events, the verticality?Hint for future players defy your natural instincts and follow the main story in Act 2 instead of exploring everything before getting to it. Itll send you off to explore anyway, but in a more fun way.Act 3 is... huge. Its probably bigger than Acts 1 and 2 combined  which makes sense, you expect the city to be lively. And the stories are still all right in theory, but  well, half of them just dont deliver. The game fails to fulfill its ambitions.You can side with Gortash and his sensible evil proposal except all you get is the inability to finish some companion quests and discover perhaps the biggest twist in the story, you cant get a normal evil ruler ending. That deal with the devil you made? A short cutscene in the end and nothing more. A non-illithid cant control the Netherbrain, except if you make a treacherous choice in the final cutscene, where you suddenly totally can. It feels good to gather allies for the final battle, but each of them only utters a single phrase  less than random characters in the street!Generally speaking, siding with evil never feels like an equal choice past Act 1. It feels like a way to skip a boss fight. Youre never rewarded by content for it.You cant even discuss the final events with my whole party  only the three characters you took with you! How does that make any sense! Not to mention that companions have little to say over the course of the whole act, and there are zero to none unique interactions between them like the conflict between Laezel and Shadowheart in Act 1 and this is in the part of the story where I want their insights the most, to see how theyve changed.Dont get me wrong, the final conflict is still... all right. It offers no surprises and has too many moving parts, and your mysterious Guardian plays a role too technical and not compelling enough. And youre very much railroaded into the good ending. But its still interesting and epic compared to other games.Its just that my expectations were set much higher. Because Act 1 was so brilliant.CONCLUSIONStill one of the best CRPGs ever. Buy it. Play it.Just temper the expectations Act 1 sets. The game wont hold to the same insane standard of quality, and honestly, its okay. Even 50 hours of that quality is a treasure. I loved it. I bought Baldurs Gate 3, like many others, caught up in the wave of hype surrounding its release. At first, it didnt grab me. With no prior experience playing Dungeons  Dragons and not being a fan of turn-based combat, I struggled to connect with the game. The mechanics felt foreign, and I found myself drifting away to play other titles.But something about Baldurs Gate 3 kept pulling me back. I gave it another shot, and then, it clicked. I started to enjoy the combat, figuring out how to use the environment to my advantage, and I realized just how much influence you can wield outside of battle. Conversations, choices, and strategies became just as important as swinging a sword or casting a spell.I became invested in the characters, more than I have in any other game. Well, most of them  I dont like Wyll. His story just felt underwhelming compared to the others. Each companion had depth and complexity that kept me hooked. The freedom the game offers is truly unparalleled. I could shape my own story in ways that felt meaningful. I found myself losing track of time, wanting to know what would happen next.Fast forward 150 hours!, and Ive just finished my first playthrough. Without a doubt, this is the best game Ive ever played, and Ive played a LOT of games. The sense of emptiness it leaves behind is almost painful. All I want to do is dive back in and start a new run. Taking suggestions on what character or class to try nextIn summary, yes, I wholeheartedly recommend Baldurs Gate 3. Its an unforgettable experience that sets a new standard for storytelling and player agency in games.PS Be warned, though after playing Baldurs Gate 3, other games may feel linear and their characters shallow in comparison. As someone who has never played a game like this before, I debated a long time before forking over the cash for it. I know zero about DD, have never played any kind of strategy game before.I havent finished the game yet, but can tell you without a doubt its one of my favorite games Ive ever played. Its story-rich, the gameplay is incredibly fun, the characters are very well written. Its a 1010 for me! Best game ever! This is the best videogame I have played in decades. I feel like I curled up with a great book for 281 hours while binge-watching an epic series, all while playing a game that felt challenging but also super rewarding. The storytelling is amazing! There is actual character development, and things dont always go the way you expect they will when you start off.Things you experience in the first act come back around way later in my case over 100 hours later and your choices MATTER. Playing this at the same time as a lot of my friends and activity feed was especially fun because everyone had a totally different experience, which means that there is solid replay value here. I am already planning my next-- and the next after that -- playthrough!Its not 100 perfect, the UI and particularly inventory and party management systems could be less cumbersome and if Larian doesnt take care of that, I am sure the modding community will but it is damn close! With years in early access, the first act has clearly been tested much more than what follows, and there are some buggy experiences. But, wow, what experiences they are! This game is so dense in Act 3 that it almost is a little overwhelming. Baldurs Gate 3 IS the most polished game Ive played in ages, and for once I dont feel like I bought half a game and will be buying the rest of the game later, one dlc at a time.",

        "class": "negative",
        "text": "This game doesnt deserve to be called Baldurs Gate.Its not a bad game as such, but it comes up short.Theres plenty of positive things to say about this game The gameplay and combat is pretty good throughout, more or less emulating 5e DD combat with some changes. The game is pretty nice looking and the production values are generally high even if the over-the-top high fantasy aesthetics dont appeal to me personally. Theres some good performances in the game as well and its very impressive that the game is fully voiced other than your PC in dialogue, which I dont count against the game. Overall the game is impressively ambitious. Some of these things are something of a double edged sword though, more on that later.So, while most of my negatives will be very much up to taste, it is undeniable that the game is unfinished. The entire game is janky in every aspect, but the further into the game you go, the rougher it gets. Then it almost completely falls apart toward the end. Performance takes a huge hit, weird glitches and bugs start appearing both visual and gameplay, quests start breaking, dialogue scenes start breaking, enemies see you through walls, people start conversations with you from a mile away. Its really bad.Your choices end up having very little impact in the end. Especially one persistent, very foreshadowed choice that you choose to do or not do throughout the game, ends up seemingly making no difference at all. Toward the end NPC interactivity drops significantly, wherein almost every NPC becomes an animatronic puppet barking single lines of dialogue, where you cannot interact with them like you would in any other CRPG. It feels like companions stop participating in the story almost altogether, sans their personal questlines. Some of this is present before the final act as well, but toward the end is where it becomes very jarring. This is part of the aforementioned double edged sword for wanting to voice and animate all dialogue in the game.It also feels like they cut an entire area out of the final act, an area for which you can see an entrance but can never access. That is fair I suppose, as they didnt manage to populate even what they had with meaningful content, I wouldnt want to see it spread out even further.But then theres other CRPGs Ive loved even though theyve had lackluster or unfinished final acts, such as Tyranny. So what are the other problems?I said that the gameplay is pretty good, but it has its own share of problems. In tabletop DD 5e, the DM should be careful about making their combat scenarios too large, because the system scales pretty poorly and becomes a slog. Same is true here, and Larian was not careful about scaling their combats. There are many mass combats with way too many participants that end up being tedious drudgery. It becomes even more tedious when the game has its characteristic slowdowns where enemies just stand there for 30 seconds before apparently succumbing to analysis paralysis and skipping their turn. This game is so janky.Then when it is your turn, youll have to contend with some very bad user interface and user experience. Targeting your spells becomes maddening when the AoE indicator keeps wiggling and flickering around. Good luck not hitting your allies.Sometimes the game just kind of freezes for about 5 seconds just to figure out whats going on. Sometimes the game will tell you, you have a 100 chance of hitting... and then you miss 3 times in a row. What?Then theres the jank of party control, or more accurately lack of control. Its fine most of the time, except when you present me with areas with traps and hazards which are triggered by characters stepping on them, and then have my party step on everything without my say-so. Not to speak of when a party member just decides to stop following you for some reason. Wheres Shadowheart again? Oh, shes on the other side of the map standing in front of a chest high wall every other companion jumped on top of no problem. This game is SO janky.In general the quality of life and usability features of this game are very lacking. Inventory management and looting especially is a bane for the entire game.I really dont like the camping system. Youre just whisked away into a pocket dimension in an instant, a place that is always safe regardless if your camp is in the middle of a dangerous dungeon. No watches, no wandering encounters, no meaningful consideration for resources or safety. This may not be a big deal to many, for me this hurts the immersion of feeling like this is an adventure. For reference, if you want to see this kind of system done right, play Kingmaker. In fact, my general advice is to play Kingmaker instead of this regardless.Then theres the writing, which is what I think truly makes this game unworthy of having the name Baldurs Gate. It manages to be kind of entertainingly cartoony at best, and pretty bad at worst. The companions are a very mixed bag with middling highs and steep lows. So many of them have a kind of a coolest guy ever syndrome going on, where they have these incredibly over-the-top grandiose backstories. Were level 1 or 2, and my companions are formerly paramours of gods, right hands of an archdevil and the most notorious warlock-batman of the whole region. Its ridiculous, and so lame. Theres a couple exceptions, though. Astarion and Shadowheart turned out to be ok as characters.Oh and everyone wants to have sex with you, for some reason? I think Larian imagines that the end goal of any positive human relationship is to have sex. It gets even worse when all sorts of otherwordly being start wanting to bonk you as well. Its embarrassing, and juvenile.The story and writing generally runs the gamut from tropey and shallow, to childishly melodramatic. Plenty of ironic detachment, Marvel-style smug quips, squeecore, and scenes where it feels like youre a receptacle for exposition rather than a character. If youre looking for something with depth, maturity, interesting character dynamics, or complexity you wont find it here. I think pretty early on there was a villain who wanted to kill a kid without a good reason other than she was just that bad? You wont find a character like Jon Irenicus in this game, Im afraid.Oh and the humor. I was afraid of seeing Larian -style wacky humor, and Larian provided. Comedy is probably more subjective than most other types of writing, but man the sort of 2010s style random internet humor stuff doesnt work for me at all.Im not pretending that BG 1 or 2 were perfectly written. Both had their quirks and clichs, but it was much more nuanced and complex than this, especially for its time.Another Baldurs Gate games did much better as well was being able to portray a world and place with a reasonable degree of verisimilitude. You felt like a character inhabiting a place in the world. BG3 feels more like walking around a high-fantasy theme park. It seems like Larian really favors having big open maps where everything in the current section in the world is present seamlessly, but it makes plot points like None of our scouts can find this place thats next door 5 minute walk away from here feel really ridiculous.I feel like this property was given to the wrong hands, or maybe shouldnt have been given to anyone at all. The game is fun, and impressive in many ways. However, Baldurs Gate deserved better than a just okay CRPG with a big budget, low artistic ambitions, and all-encompassing jank. This game was really good, up until Act 3. Then it all falls apart with bugs - brokenmissing dialog, odd camera angles, clipping in scenery. Not to mention the story just takes a weird turn and all the mystery and choice get boiled away into a  pretty underwhelming situation that makes little sense. It feels like the game was gutted right before release and the ending is still in early access. Id hold off on buying for now and wait for the inevitable patches and finished story  dialog  quests to be added, as its disappointing to spend so much time working up to such a weak final act. I started out really enjoying this game. In fact there is a lot there to enjoy. I havent gotten too far but the base combat, the early story, the companions so far all work for me. However the further along I went the MORE and MORE it bothered me that there is no real partygroup mechanics for conversations. The whole fact that whoever initiated a conversation or had one initiated via proximity is essentially the only character that can do anything and is the one all skill checks are based on just sours the experience in a way that is hard for me personally to move past.I really like using my player character as the face of the party, but having to rely solely on them regardless of circumstance makes me feel compelled to build them certain ways. Having other characters around with useful skills for situation just sit back and do nothing leads to a desire to save scum. Its also just straight up immersion breaking to have characters who should be stepping in for something just sit back completely useless. Its the kind of thing that really generate a dissonance I personally just find grating.Ill probably push through the game on a new character more set up to be the face of the party, Im sure Ill enjoy it, but Ill still having that grating annoyance with something that I feel like should be a core aspect of a party based crpg. Mostly I want to enjoy the more having fun talking about the different choices and such with friends, if I didnt have friends also playing the game Id probably feel like I wasted my money not waiting until its cheaper.This may seem like a pedantic complaint and it probably doesnt affect most people, but its something that for me personally feels like a core feature missing and bothers me to the point it hampers the experience. Let me start by saying Buldurs Gate 3 is a great game.However i have some grief with it. My main problem is its combat system. It feels clunky, stiff and too random. And it is like that, because it is adopted from Dungeons and Dragons table top pen and paper game with all its limitations. I feel like the gaming medium allows for far better systems developers already made them in previous games.So let me go through, why dnd combat system makes this game frustrating. When you try to attack an enemy you roll your chance to hit against their defence or they roll their defence against your static attack value if you cast a spell. These rolls modified by different stats of your character and the enemy, but because enemies get stronger as the game progresses, this hit chance is around the same number, lets say 50. On top of that, the damage you deal is determined by a dice roll like 1-6, 1-8, 1-10 before modifiers. So it creates a situation, when you try to attack, your damage is determined by a random number among  all 0s are missesSo majority of a time you attack does nothing, or very little.And it wouldve been fine, if you werent limited to mostly 1 action per your turn. This means that there is a pretty high probability that your character will make little to nothing impact for multiple times in a row. If you are playing a caster character the combat is even worse. All your strong spells are limited by number of times you can cast them before you rest and replenish them. Strong spells still can be dodged by enemies, or do minimum damage. This is just like in dnd, but unlike in dnd, in BD3 you have combat encounters every 10 minutes. This means that, as a caster, most of the time, you do just normal attacks because you run out of spell slots or trying to conserve them. Resting after every combat encounter or two seems pretty impractical, because resting advances time in a game and can fail some quests for you.I know that the idea behind this game was to make a dnd game, and dnd fans would love it. But in my expirience, its not combat that makes dnd fun, but freeform improvise roleplay players and dm do. And dnds roleplay isnt possible to adapt to videogame atleast for now. So in the end, video games that try to stay true to dnd feel off to me. When you try to adapt dnd, you have this amazing roleplay part that you cant adapt to vidiogame and a below average combat system...And for Bd3 roleplay, its just a branching dialogue tree with skill checks. Its great on its own, but dnd has so much more. Like half of skills in dnd have aplication in roleplay encounters. And in Bd3 you have these skills, but you dont have a use for them.Like in dnd you have magehand, illusions and others. You have countless ways to use them in dnd, but while playing Bd3, i havent found a single use for them so far. Didnt have an option in dialogue to use them so far. Maybe you can use charm friend in dialogue, but havent tried it.I guess, my whole review can be summarised with sentence I wish, i was playing divinity 3 instead of Buldurs gate 3.Because this game feels like a downgrade from an amazing divinity 2. I wish I could post a mixed review. It may seem strange to post a negative review after playing over 150h, but act 3 killed all my enthusiasm.I like Larians gameplay in general.Act 1 and 2 were awesome.Interactions with companions are great.Act 3 was another game, a tedious sandbox game with no overall structure.None of my actions had consequences. All quests were completely separate.It feels like there is a ton of cut content where is the upper city?.Companion interactions in act 3 are still bugged for the majority.The final fights were the most boring shit Ive ever been through.The game should have ended with act 2. I would give it a 910 if it was the case. There are so many ways that this game is GREAT It looks great - it plays well no crashes - the Story is great... Even epic, but it feels NOTHING like Baldurs gate.  It just isnt working as a Baldurs Gate game for me at allIf they wanted a DD license then fine - make a DD game and do what they have done, which is transplant the DD 5E rules onto their own Divinity game system - all the way up to stepping in fire burning and throwing some water onto the fire putting it out. etc.  That would be great, I might play it  call it Faerun Adventures or something.   But I feel that when you take on a beloved Intellectual Property then you have a responsibility to make it feel like the original gamesSo, as I have said  there are many great things about the game, so whats wrong from my point of view?Mostly its the combat, but a little party movement too - it feels very pen and paper, in the sense one person acts and rolls etc. then the next, and in many ways thats great.   But in a Pen and Paper game I can say to the DM Im jumping over the fires, assume thats what I do if I have to cross one - or I will go around if I cant safely jump over. The DM might want a Jump check for a long-complicated jump - but as a DM I wouldnt ask a player to roll 15 jump rolls to maneuver around a burning ship.  Because It gets boring.  But having to maneuver 4 players  one at a time  to jump them over a fire is a lot more boring on a computer screen  because it takes longer than four Players each rolling a dice in a Pen and Paper game and because the other characters follow the leader they can sometimes walk into the flames anyway  unless you separate them and do it even more one at a time.  As a DM I also wouldnt assume that stepping in a flammable liquid would mean that the liquid somehow magically appeared all over the players body and the player would burst into flames for several rounds.  Maybe their feet would get covered in some liquid, maybe they would take a tiny amount of fire damage if they werent wearing thick leggings of some sort.    Maybe they would fall in it if it was grease not oil.  But all that depends on how much I would want my players to enjoy their game play and how caught up in the minutia of realism I want to try to be.  Mostly I opt for fun.Then there is the actual combat.  Its long and boring to watch each move plod, plod, plod then attack one at a time and MISS and MISS and MISS. Thats my main gripe.  The time it takes to have each fight.  BG and BG2 fights were simple and quick, action and heroism. Part of the problem is the low - non heroic - ability scores.  Let me ROLL my character!  That way I can get an 18 here and there and expect that my characters will be HEROIC locking scores at 15 doesnt bode well for my heroes adventuring career in my opinion  they will run into combat to face their evil foe and have the strength to hammer them, the constitution to take a hit or two and the battle will be over a whole lot quicker. Because they will not miss as much  die as much and Im not going to have to try battles twice because I came into a major fight  like the one at the druid grove gates  without having just rested. Rolling characters to me is part of the DD experience and fun, as is being a little heroic and kicking arse and taking names. Being above average to an heroic level.  I dont mean I couldnt wipe etc. just that its less likely with my buff main character.  Thats the sort of thing I enjoy. So I think rolling characters is a must and some movement AI improvements so that the non-controlled characters will automatically jump over fire, acid etc.  or other obvious hazards as they follow the controlled character. I think the Pen and Paper style combat has a place  the Divinity game proves its popular.  But the Baldurs gate combat was always so much more simple and  fun.  I mean, pick a script for each character.  Pause the game and issue orders if the fight is tough enough to need it.   Watch the game play itself through the easier fights.  Get more done.  Explore more.  Follow the story more.  Handle the big fights by controlling each character if you need to  or the fights where you havent been able to rest etc and are low on health and spells.  Just my opinion on BG3.I cant help compare the game to Solasta Crown of the Magister.  Ive played Solasta to the point the early access stops.  The combat is more fun.  No worry about stepping in fire etc. and all four characters are rolled and so are a bit more heroic and fun, because they have better stats.  So no, Miss. Miss, Miss.  They still miss  but they do it less often.  maybe the BG3 engine isnt very random or something - I have lost count of critical misses but almost never see a critical hit I am also assuming the stats of the enemys in Solasta are a little lower and the combat balance allows for an slightly easier time of it.Anyway I guess most people will not read this much  maybe the devs will   but thanks for your time if you have. BG3 is a Good Game for the majority of its story. Act 1, easily 1010. Act 2, again, top marks, Id give it an 810.Act 3 however, is where the story falls apart. There is a TON of cut content for it, like the entire Upper City which is missing despite being talked about a month before release. One companion is literally missing a chunk of her questline due to it BEING IN THE UPPER CITY. The game also sort of railroads you into good playthroughs, doing an evil run will have you loose 3 of your potential 9 companions, two of which dont show up until act 3. Theres also no consequences for using illithid powers, despite everyone acting as though there would be. The gameplay itself is good, but the story just falls apart IMO in the last stretch. Id advise waiting to buy until Larian goes back and re-adds the cut content, for sure. Will get hate for this, but want to voice that this game is not for everyone.The sheer amount of micromanagement you have to do in this game drove me crazy. Companions are all unrealisticly horny to the point that its just annoying. Have to go back to camp and long rest after every couple combat encounters unless you want all your party members to just whack stuff. WARNING LOW VISION PLAYERS, or any player needing larger UI  fonttext size  scaling for your setup...Game currently has no accessibility option for increasing UIfonttext size!There is an option for dialog text size, but not for majority of other text in UI menus, tooltips, etc. which is more critical to read during gameplay, since the dialog has voice acting anyway.This makes me very sad  disappointed as a low vision disabled player because I really enjoy these types of games and wanna play this highly anticipated game, but currently cannot because it strains my eyes too much trying to read the tiny text everywhere.I hope to update my review to Recommend once larger UIfonttext size is supported, and I really wish developers are more inclusive  mindful of disabled people as a launch priority rather than some backlog feature monthsyears later -- not everyone can seehearcontrol games in a single standard experience, and it further reinforces the treatment of disabled gamers needs as inferior  unimportant. Going to make this short. Do not buy this at full price until they actually finish the game. During almost the entirety of my play through, I would have given it a near perfect 1010. Then I got to the final ending sequence of the game. It was so bad and contrary to the rest of the build up of the entire game that it left me speechless for like 5 minutes. I am still amazed as to how terribly handled the ending is. The ending is like 210 and that pulls the rest of the game to a 710 at best. With that said though, the fact that the ending left me so crushed with disappointment makes me not recommend it to people. It was such a let down. All of those allies you were gathering, practically useless. Those relationship stories you were diligently building have no conclusion. Gales conclusion non existent, Lazels too, and Shadowheart, Astarion... All of the things you wanted to see be improved through your effort are never shown to you. Instead you get some hammed up BS ending on a dock that looks slapped together and perpetually glitchy.This game is akin to watching a world record breaking marathon runner trip right before the finish line, mess their pants and then instead of getting up, just lays there on the ground and calls it quits.I think that the ending of this game and the soulless drek that is Starfield, has broken gaming for me for a long while. Just finished the game. This was a lovehate experience for me. On the one hand, BG3 was overall very solid and proved that a game could be packed with content and love for the player on release. On the other hand, certain aspects of the game itself just did not work for me along with some plot holes and performance drop in Act 3. Everything I liked about the game had to do with the Larian aspects of it. That is, the overall feel, the battles, the storytelling. I loved that initial excitement of creating your character and setting off into the world. Most of that feeling was kept through Act 1. Much of the writing and voice acting was fantastic, especially Karlach.-- Most things I hated about the game involved the DD implementations. Yes, white knights, I knew it was DD going into it. I just thought the Original Sin 2 vibe would be enough to keep me happy. -- Rolling dice for EVERYTHING got cumbersome. Combine that with such a high rate of failure in conversations and environment checks, youre forced to save scum every 5 minutes. Otherwise, youd be completely locked out of certain threads. No, I dont want to replay the entire game just to see what an option did. -- On that vein  In OS2, you either had the option unlocked to Persuade or you didnt depending on your stats. In BG3, having large dice bonuses in Persuasion make you feel like you should have a silk tongue, yet you still fail because of crap rolls and ridiculous difficulty classes, leading to a completely avoidable fightdeath of a major NPC. Or, on paper your bonuses suggest youre a master thief. One day you unlock a large gate leading to immense treasure and forgotten secrets, the next youre thwarted by a simple box with an apple in it. These types of instances make you feel less connected to your characters and the world around them. Too inconsistent.-- Resting started to feel like an unnecessary detour after awhile. I got to a point where I was ignoring conversations because I just wanted to finish the game. -- While the combat style was fun, the limitations on skill usage got pretty annoying. This is where I missed the OS2 style where you had action points and could use whatever skills that turn as long as you had the points to use them.-- Having only 12 levels and those thresholds being spaced so far apart, along with some of the levels having very little advancement for your character, took the excitement out of leveling up. Thats a huge problem.-- Some of the decisions I made early on just never came to fruition for some reason, almost like an avenue wasnt considered. For example, I accepted Raphaels contract, and just decided to completely ignore it. I never did anything else involving our agreement. At endgame, there was no reference to Raphael or our agreement..nothing, despite it being a binding contract we made. In fact, in the prologue Karlach made reference to the fact that I was saved. How? We failed to complete his contract and never found a way to get out of it. By all rights, Raphael should have taken my soul. This felt like either cut content or something that was never addressedconsidered in the first place.-- During the final battle,  Zevlor spawned in as an enemy and not an ally. No idea why. I saved him from the Ilithid base even. Played the battle a couple times, always spawned in as an enemy. Made absolutely no sense. -- One thing I will knock Larian for is the way they finish games. The last act always feels less engaging than the previous ones across all their games of this style. The ending itself was just...okay bye. I think they even added a couple epilogue scenes to it post launch, but that didnt seem to help the fact that it just fell flat.Im sure there is more Im not thinking of right now. But it seems like this was not a good place to use the DD rule set in my humble opinion. So the games finally out and I feel like I can update the review. Unfortunately, this is still a thumbs down from me. Im sure that many people will enjoy it, and Larian is certainly not trying to rip you off or anything, but in MY OPINION, while the art is great and the combat is generally good, the game overall is immature, the world-building is mediocre, and BG 3 is not a worthy successor of Baldurs Gate 1 and 2. So lets break down things a bit1. The music. Its phenomenal. Just great.2. The artmap artwork is outstanding. Some of the maps are just breathtakingly beautiful Temple of Lathander is my favorite so far. Note, I dont like the map design so much, where everything is jammed together, but aesthetically they are top notch.3. The combat is pretty good, with two notable exeptions. 5E is a pretty good combat system and Larian has stayed largely faithful. Their addition of weapon-specfic special attacks works well. Where it really breaks down is shoving. In BG3, shoving is king, and it often breaks the combat. There are three interlocking problems BG3 makes shoving a bonus action so you can attack AND shove, it increased the shove distance from 5 feet to A LOT, and it made big fights very vertical - with lots of ledges and bottomless pits. This introduces a lot of save-or-die Athletics checks either when you are shoving an enemy or the enemy is shoving you that just break the system. Theyre especially prevalent in big battles - for example, of the six big battles in Act I, 4 have save-or-die shove mechanics, either from bottomless pits, high heights, or pits with monsters. The second major issue is surfaces and grenades, which make armor and concentration spells less valuable. I know Larian loves shoving and surfaces, but its too much.4. The potential party members are good in some ways and terrible in others. Honestly, the writing and quips are mostly fine. The romances seem like they were written by and for teenagers with no idea what real romance actually is I mean, these NPCs are throwing themselves at me just because Im not a jerk - its ... off-putting. By far the worst though are the origins of your companions - theyre all super special snowflakes, the Coolest Adventurers That Ever Cooled, who just went down to level one because of the tadpole. They honestly outshine the player character, and thats REALLY BAD. The PC should be the hero of the story, but the other party members are just written to be so much better than you. Larian did this in DOS2 as well and I hated it. Its like playing with a DM who made a bunch of super-cool NPCs that are just better than the players. Very lame.5. The world building is where this game really fails for me. BG1 and BG2 felt like real, lived-in places, with politics, economies BG1s whole plot was economic intrigue, and towns where people live. BG3 feels like a series of disconnected set pieces and the world breaks down as soon as you think about it. Worldbuilding doesnt mean putting a few books in and referencing place names, but thats the Larian approach. The problem is that theres no deeper thought into making sure things make sense. There are tons of examples of this from two brothers walking 10 days from Baldurs Gate to find their sister, to the merchants constantly refreshing their supplies, etc. Honestly, I think this is less Larian and more modern DD - which has moved away from realistic fantasy worlds to exciting fantasy fights. I hate Critical Role, for instance I find it shallow and splashy - the Michael Bay of fantasy. If you like Critical Role, youll probably like the world that BG3 builds for you. Just be aware that it doesnt compare favorably to BG 12. This lack of consistencyinternal realism is a big turn-off for me and if youre about to say why are you looking for realism in a game with dragons? just realize that this statement isnt the burn you think it is, but rather says a lot about the low-brow fantasy you obviously enjoy.6. UIItemizationinventory management. Its really bad. Its the same system as DOS2 - it was bad then and its bad now a clogged action bar Solasta does the 5E UI just so MUCH better, even if the game is much rougher than BG3 overall, too many magic itemsdifferent items to track in inventory, no good way to sort things, and merchants with better items than what you find after epic quests the only 2 item I saw in Act 1 was in the Zhent merchant at the Goblin Camp. This isnt a key point for me, but yeah, its certainly bad.7. They really treated the original voice actor for Minsc poorly by refusing to bring him back to voice the character that HE made so iconic yes, Jim Cummings wanted to reprise his role. Instead they went with Matt Mercer because Matt is popular and Minsc is popular. By all means, write another character for Matt I think hes very talented, but writing Jim out of BG3 really reflects poorly on Larian and honestly on Matt for taking the gig.Anyways, buy it if you like. Im disappointed in it given the resources, time remember, they originally said 2021, and source material they had to work with I feel like its come up short. This is a game who does not really know what it wants to be. Its ambitious, engaging, and enjoyable. Its also torn between two systems, and I fear that Larian will only make this worse as they go along.Larians character system is taken right out of DD 5e. This is actually a good thing. 5e has quite a lot going for it, but the biggest thing is the extensive play testing it has received as a combat system. 5e DD has been around for awhile now, and it does an excellent job of providing robust classes that work in the 5e combat system. Except for Ranger. They botched that one.The problem here is that Larian is not building their encounter system to fit DD 5e. The Red Cap encounter is an excellent example. A monster who opens an engagement on a character with a 3D10 attack is utterly lethal at the level youll encounter said monster at. That damage level is usually seen around level 7-9 with serious help, or with a specialized ability. Add to the damage that it can knock your character prone, and youve got a serious balance issue. In this encounter, there are three of them. This isnt the only time Larian tilts the fight heavily out of your favor. In early early release, the enemy would focus fire a character into the grave once they were in the dying state. With a three hit multi-attack in a certain encounter Which a PC class cant pull off without dual-wield and multi-attack at level 5 or a fighter at 11, you basically watched a character go down, and get executed. Larian also brought back the Divinity cheese that are exploding barrels. Need to wipe out an entire legion of individuals? Throw a barrel at them when theyre all standing together. Have your friend stealthed out, and wait for it to land. The tosser may end up in combat, but youre stealthy friend is completely free to move about the world. One fire attack later, and youve got a mob bar-b-que. Note, some targets may not die because theyve got a pile of hitpoints appropriate for their level.I dont really take issue with the early access bugs. Thats to be expected. Theyre in the game, and they can screw up your run. You knew that when you bought it as an early access. I take issue with the design philosophy. This is a game trapped between a strong 5e rule set that is the most play tested gaming system on the planet, and the utter madness of the Divinity game mechanics. What made the Divinity system work was the unparalleled flexibility it gave its player in building synergies. This allowed the player to cope with an ever increasingly complex threat portfolio. You could died pretty often. You might have to completely strip down your character and re-build them, floor up. In one session, your favorite character was a sword slicing, lightning slinging, plated armor warrior. In the next, he was a No-Hecks-Given, watch-the-world-burn Pyromaniacal mage. This is not how 5e operates. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, and player creativity has to be employed to solved the various challenges the game brings. Usually through team work. By adding the kind of mechanics that belonged in Divinity, the game design strains the system of 5e to its very limits. Larians solution in Baldurs Gate is to let you face check the newest bastardized concept theyve introduced, and mark your death down in their statistics. Youre going to die, and itll come down to a badly designed attack that you didnt know could happen, and had no solution for prior to its deployment. If youre fine with that, then the game might be for you.I also take issue with some of the characters. Gale, specifically. His back story is ridiculously stupid, considering hes a basic level one wizard. No spoilers here, but how did someone who cant even cast second level spells at your first meeting manage to pull off everything he says he did? Maybe hes lying. Maybe I need to murder him and leave him in a ditch. Probably that one. I strongly recommend waiting until this title is out of early access before considering purchasing it.  Many of the DD 5e features Im interested in playing seem like they will not be available until full release e.g. Tier II combat, multi-classing, Paladin class.  The Early Access content release has been continuous, but it is really slow going. TLDR With a heavy heart, I must admit that I am not having a good time, but you might!TLDR2 If you enjoy the cRPG genre, this game is almost certainly for you and Im surprised you havent bought it yet in light of its near universal acclaim, why are you reading this?I bought this game on the back of the universally positive reception. I can see why it has its stellar reputation. I believe it deserves its reputation, with a caveat If you havent been able to get into cRPGs in the past due to the various dice-based systems, but saw the reviews and thought that this product might transcend your expectations, I think you will be disappointed, primarily due to the prevalence of a large number of dice rolls that can instantly kill you or wipe your party.I started off having a great time, the world is carefully crafted, the characters Ive met are interesting and well written. There are so many options given to the player when wandering the world, from using abilities to talk to animals or corpses to gain special advantages or insight, to expected for this genre skullduggery of sneaking, pickpocketing, and lockpicking your way to success.Unfortunately, as I started to get further into Act 1, I started getting killed by the dice repeatedly. I found an enemy lying on the ground wounded and, though the game did warn me approaching was dangerous, I was curious about what I might be able to learn from them. The game threw a dice roll at me that I failed, and my character was immediately killed, forcing a reload. I hadnt saved in awhile, so I lost some progress. No big deal, Ive learned my lesson, I thought to myself, Ill just save more frequently so that I dont lose so much progress like that again. So I approached the situation differently the next time and avoided death.Hours of gameplay passed in Act 1. I was still having a decent time, and I was especially having fun talking to people, using my persuasion and clever wits to gain advantages and access new content. I scraped past some difficult fights with enemies that I thought were fairly challenging, and Ive have to reload after mismanaging a fight or failing to take something into account.Then the fights got harder, and harder, and harder. Enemies vastly outnumber you, each enemy gets their own dice to roll against you. More dice against you means theyre going to roll more critical successes, which they did, frequently. I encountered a fight near a cave in act 1. The first time I entered the area, my party was wiped on the first round. The second time I was wiped on the first round. It kept happening. Critical success rolls given to enemies with multiple attacks would kill my characters in a single turn. I tried to prioritize the heavy hitters, but could not do enough damage before theyd wipe my party in short order. I gave up and tried to approach the fight from a different angle. I was able to initiate dialog and get one of the tough enemies on my side through my social and magical abilities, and barely squeaked out a victory!All the enemies dead Dialog was immediately initiated by the character I had earlier convinced to fight for me with the closest of my party members. This party member was not my designated talker, failed his dice rolls, and was attacked. Several of my other characters, wounded or dying, were unable to assist. My party was wiped. Game over. The fight had lasted nearly an hour. Id need to reload a save again. I realized I was not enjoying being killed by the dice. I felt no desire to repeat the endeavor. I closed the game, and I now leave this review.I might revisit the game again sometime, but I suspect that this type of game is just not for me. I dont have the experience with dice-based combat that could help me succeed in situations like this, and I find the experience so punishing that I do not have any desire to get good constantly reloading saves to try and figure out what I am supposed to do to progress. I desperately want to experience more of this games writing, narrative, and interesting choices, but they feel inaccessible to me gated behind tactical dice-based combat that is punishing and cruel.My understanding is that in actual DD sessions, a good GM is responsible for ensuring the players enjoy themselves, in spite of the challenges they are presented. I did not feel like there was a good GM behind the scenes. I felt a cold calculating computer, looming over me with murderous intent, forcing me to reload saves. 14 hours and FIFTY quicksaves later, I am putting this game down, disappointed and cant offer a recommendation to any of my friends who arent already in love with cRPGs. This officially delineates, for me, a product that is too early access. Save your money and wait for final release. I should have read the fine print and as a warning I am summarizing it for youBuy this game only if you want to support Larians financial department. Not for a product you want to extract enjoyment out of.Now I will summarize why that is a terrible idea- They are a profitable company with two big successes in recent years with products in the same genre- Unless they are mismanaged they should be solvent enough to produce a game using their own funds- Theres really no reason they should be early accessing a game in this genre. Its not niche and its not something they dont have a formula for. This should be about tweaking, not starting from the ground up. With the state of the early access I very much question what they are going to extract from this other than cash. - If they dont want to put their money where their mouth is on a tried in true IP in a popular genre having years of past experience, why should you?I think its time Early Access and helping fund games through 0 risk crowd sourcing is limited to actually small studios with no alternative sources of funding to go to. While Larian might not be considered triple A they are not a pair of dudes living at low to low-mid salaries developing a passion product. Its cute to say you are involving the fans but frankly I dont see a real mechanism in place like to pull that criticism in. They dont even give it lip service as others, like Amplitude, might. Frankly this is just pre-purchasing that will just suck in a few more dollars while tricking consumers.This is something corporate tells you is a win-win- Finance can use reviews as an indicator on when to cut funding! Its not our fault look at the reviews!- Fits into the agile framework of constant deliverables with stakeholders you involvement- Outsourced testing to the stakeholder you- Stakeholder feedback! you know, cherry picked from assumedly from whoever is loudest with no mechanism for actually collecting it Frankly this is just a repainting of the 3rd bullet point on this list about testingSorry, Im tired of companies getting to remove the risk from engaging in business while giving me nearly nothing in return. Its sugar coated bullshit. So I should preface that I really loved Divinity Original Sin 2, and Larian as a whole. This isnt meant to be mean, or to be an attack on the creators of BG3, nor the people that like it. Its my opinion on the issue that the game has. I hope it changes, but I acknowledge that it likely wont.I like 5e. I like Divinity Original Sin 2. The systems for each are fun in their own right, but this feels like 5e was pasted onto dos2 and I dont think 5e really works within the framework of a single player video game. At the end of the day the system revokes player agency. Your RP choices dont matter. Your attention to detail dont matter. Your combat  plans dont matter. EVERYTHING is down to the roll of dice. Regardless of your capabilities as a player there is always a chance at failure. In a tabletop environment, playing with other people this is fine. It adds to the narrative being constructed as you play. You adapt, your fellow players adapt, and the GM adapts as you succeed and fail. This isnt a group tabletop environment. This is a single player video game.It is far from rewarding to pay attention to the game, but be denied options because I failed passive skill checks. It is far from rewarding when Im am denied role playing choices because I fail skill checks. It is far from rewarding when I use the environment and my party as effectively as possible, but I get critical failure after critical failure. Everything is up to chance, and in the end, there is little to no agency that can truly be found in the game.Now, one might say that the failure adds to your personal story - but again, there is no agency given to the player for those failures. No amount of bonuses can guarantee success and so when you fail something that you built your character for, or have been role playing toward it doesnt feel like you brought the failure onto yourself, but rather the RNG system of the game randomly decided that you failed. Whats worse is that random chance can end up deciding your XP gains, and attitude changes from companions.This system of deciding success both through active and passive rolls really and truly removes the agency that was felt in DOS2 and the tabletop rpg genre.Everything that makes 5e what it is, including the reliance on chance to decide success and failure requires the tabletop environment to be viable and fun. Even then, GMs can decide to wave dice rolls if they deem the roll unnecessary, ie players taking notes, being attentive, or roleplaying well. You cant do any of that in a video game. And so very core of the game play just doesnt work here in this format.Because of what ultimately feels genuinely unrewarding system that flippantly punishes the player based solely on the results of a random number generator and that there is no human arbitrator actively participating in the results of those rolls I cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone.If you want to play a modern, immersive RPG then go play Divinity Original Sin 2. If you want to play a Baldurs Gate game then play BG1 or BG2. If you want the tabletop experience then find an online group.I truly hope that they gut the d20 system out of BG3 before launch, or allow players a choice between the 5e system and that of DOS2. It is upsetting to say as a fan of Larian, Dungeons  Dragons, the genre, and the setting... But I regret buying Baldurs Gate 3, at least for the full price it was at the time. EDIT I have just started playing this game now that it is officially out to see if the problems in this review were addressed. So far, my experience has been very similar to that of my Early Access playtime an unpolished gem, tarnished in just enough areas to cause frustration but not enough to stop the shine. If this quality continues throughout the game, then I am happy to say that the game has exceeded expectations.PRE-FINAL EDIT I was right. The game becomes increasingly linear as you progress with far less variations in possible impacting outcomes later. There are more bugs the more Ive progressed that have forced me to restore earlier saves poison cloud vent that wont get sealed, a boss that bugged and wouldnt die, mithral didnt spawn after destroying a node, etc. and its ended up becoming frustrating at times to struggle to get the game to do what I tell it. Camera is also super wonky at stages after Act 1. I promise I will play through the game in its entirety and give it a fair chance before I make claims that it has devolved into my worst fears and criticisms after Act 1.EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI have played Larian games in the past, and found them highly enjoyable. I have also played both previous Bladurs Gate games the franchise has a special place for me, since moving around so much meant I often spent many hours on the computer until I made more friends. When Larian put up Baldurs Gate 3 for Early Access, I purchased it, eager to support the games development and knowing that I would intend on playing it on full release anyway. Now, after all of this time, after playing all of Act 1, I can safely sayThis is a ripoff. Dont buy it.The Early Access for this game was released in October of 2020 this means it was after the most devastating early months of the COVID pandemic. When it was released, it was advertised as being over 50 completed and slated for a late 2021 release date. I laughed, knowing that meant it would be 2022 at the latest, and purchased it anyway if its playable and that close to completion, Ill just have to wait a bit!However, over the past two years of development, we have seen goalposts moved at every stage. New features are constantly being added to the development cycle, features that were not originally advertised by the developer. While there was a statement by Larian in which they indicated that they intended on including all Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition classes and races, it was made clear that the priority was to finish the games story first and add these features in later.That is not what has transpired.Two years of constantly adding new races, classes, skills, side quests, romancing options, anything other than actual development of the principal game. Every new feature has been great - no, really, I cannot in good faith say that these features were bad - but they are a distraction from what is important. And now, with yet again no release date and the window being moved to 2023, no development roadmap, no transparency, and the devs clarifying that Early Access will never see more than the first 4 levels of character progression and an incomplete Act 1, the same good faith that stops me from claiming the game is of poor quality also pushes me to say that this game is a waste of money.In the wake of all negative threads and comments being mass-deleted by power-tripping community managers who are claiming that people are being rude while the ride-or-die fanbase outright insults and lies everyone who dares to question the almighty dev team, it has become patently obvious to many that this game is not developing as people have wished for. On Steam, on their Discord, on the Larian and BG3 forums - no matter where you go, if the dev team has administrative access to the discussion, they are bludgeoning all comments questioning the state of development into submission.This inexcusable behavior, coupled with everything else that is lacking from the development of this Early Access title, results in just one sensible conclusionThe game sucks and until Larian makes sweeping changes to its transparency and sets a legitimate release date, dont fall for the PR and save your money. Do not buy this game.EDIT Since I submitted this review, they pushed back the release date to August instead of early 2023. I currently stand by my post, and time will tell if they have actually polished this game and have been spending their EA development delivering a complete product, or if they really have been putting all their eggs into the Act 1 basket and now are rushing to get the product out of the door like Larian has done in the past. This is much less a Dungeons and Dragons game being made by Larian, and more a Larian game with a coat of Dungeons and Dragons paint. Combat relies less on what would make sense in a DD game, and more on things that have been in previous Larian games that werent DD based but Larian seems to be completely obsessed with, like creating AoE damage on the ground by breaking barrels.If youre looking for a game that feels like youre playing Dungeons  Dragons 5E, I recommend Solasta Crown of the Magister, because this isnt it this is basically Divinity Original Sin 2 with a DD skin, but thats not what the store description sells itself as. A target image of rpgs, limited by shortcomings of unrestrained scope Wanted to love this game. I love PC rpgs, have played bg1  2, played their earlier game DoS2, I play dd irl. In many ways its best in class at what it does, and I hope it inspires just as grand competition.  Abstract  Baldurs Gate 3 will feel great in the beginning. But once you get deeper into the game the shortcomings become clear.  The good The gameplay is exemplary. I have never played a turn-based roleplay game where everything feels as fluid as BG3. Other rpgs that I find to have much more engaging writing, like one of my favourites Tyranny -by Obsidian falls short when it comes to actually playing the game and taking out your enemies. A challenging task given the complexity of tying 5e together into a cohesive experience. AWith all your Dungeons  Dragons fifth edition core options, you will be able to customise to a level rarely seen. This is a double-edged sword, which I will come back to. Moreover, The graphics is oftentimes breathtaking forget a few textures you can recognise detailed facial expressions, giving emotional depth to the game. The closer camera angle gives you a much more immersive experience.  The bad The game experiences much of the same issues as the last game Larian made Divinity Original Sin 2. Where the game starts great, cool character customisation, innovative options, high detail clarity in appearance, only to break down once you get halfway through the game. It feels like many of the decisions you made along the way, ultimately did not matter that much, or at all. Talking to your companions give you a few lines to say which you deplete rapidly. Not saying every game needs to be at a level of writing similar to Discord Elysium, but the problem is when there is no writing at all, nothing to say besides a single option go back home. With nothing more to say, you cannot reflect on the monster you just killed, or the people you just saved, or the dilemma you decided with exceptions for specific times. It feels weird exhausting the dialogue options within a few minutes, only to have nothing to say to people you walk with for spans of time afterwards. Feeling like they are just there to provide a combat role, not to be your parasocial friend imitations. How they react is quite linear do enough actions they like, few they dislike, then they will bed you as the relation bar goes up, not caring particularly about what you say. Compared to other notable rpgs where dialogue impacts how your relation turns out to be. There is limited character development, if at all, except for situations presented with a dilemma with one obvious preferred choice. Little thought seems to have been put into the evil route. You lose out of quests, the better gear, companions. Its just a worse experience with less content. I would think an evil route could tempt you with better options, with the disadvantage that you leech parasitically to a worse ending, with fewer friends. They should learn from the vast library there is out there of villainy. Taken into account, the game is thus mostly linear, even if it gives the illusion of otherwise. In other words whimsically do side quests and save people  saint, go about your own life not caring for a village or two during your supposedly pressed for time due to threat of imminent death situation  evil. It seems like a crime that in order to experience the game more fully in a completionism matter, you must work against your immersion of time stress. A breaking incentive. At least Skyrim doesnt claim you to be evil if depending on whether you postpone the main quest to do finish guild missions. As for your nemesis, I generally prefer antagonists you develop some sort of personal relation with, possibly with some plot twists along the way. Somewhat spoiler  but here you do not, only introducing villains along the way with little time to either sympathise or grow hate against. Like the project lead could not make a common thread that ties the story together, but instead making up things as they went. I would favour a more connected story where individual pieces connected as you progress.  I fear that they released their game too soon. Thus, it is too late to make structural changes. Their game DoS2 was not fixed in the same way either, where they opted to just remove romance in the Definitive Edition rather than fix the bugs. Given the enormous number of sales BG3 have gotten, I presume it is more likely that they will afford to labour their love for longer, developing their game much more.  My hot take They should have removed most character customisation, classes, races, only to focus on one in depth story. If you chose the class warlock, where you serve a patron, that relationship should be the pivotal point of the game, not just an extra encounter once or twice to check a box. I want to feel like my class, my race, my background, actually makes a significant role. The game gives you the illusion that your class matters, like when you are using the speak with dead spell to get vital info from corpses, only to find out the same info in a note on a drawer so that a different class could complete the quest as well, rendering your spell preparation quite a pointless effort. In other words, class mostly changes the way combat works. But it feels like a disconnect when it does not affect the story. It should be obvious that a master swordsman fighter, compared to an arch mage, would have quite different possible outcomes for a task. But here its distilled into slashing with a sword or dealing the same damage with a ball of fire, like a themeskin with some tactical value. It is a bit ironic that such a customisable experience, offers almost no real impact from your decisions. Thus I would prefer a Baldurs gate 3 Warlock, Baldurs Gate 4 Wizard tailored experience. I do love that the customisation exists, as it gives quite the modding potential for a tailored story, and works as a sandbox engine for either multiplayer with friends or learning dd 5e. But for the main story it works against the plot. I would rather be forced to play a specific class for bg3, other than what I would normally be, then wait for a sequel to use a different one. Or they could have gone for the Diablo way, where the game is mostly combat focused so that the customisation does not hinder the experience, but at that point then most of what bg3 tries to do goes down the drain.  In short If you love the combat aspect of Dungeons  Dragons 5e, or if you want to learn how the system works, then give Baldurs Gate 3 a go. If you expect some grand intricate story influenced by the choices you make, where you develop personal relations with companions, look elsewhere.  httpsstore.steampowered.comapp1086940BaldursGate3",
        "summary": "The gameplay and combat is pretty good throughout, more or less emulating 5e DD combat with some changes. The game is pretty nice looking and the production values are generally high even if the over-the-top high fantasy aesthetics dont appeal to me personally. Toward the end NPC interactivity drops significantly, wherein almost every NPC becomes an animatronic puppet barking single lines of dialogue."

        "text": "95 of the game is dialogue with other npcs and yourself. So if you dont want to read for 30 hours this is not the game for you. There is absolutely no combat. The RPG aspect is that you can level up different aspects of yourself like logic, reaction time, composure, endurance, etc. and as those skills come up in conversation you are having not only dialogue with the npcs but also yourself on how to proceed. It is very unique, and very awesome if you are into it. One of the most unique, thought provoking games Ive ever played. Disco Elysium is one of the best games Ive ever played. Its an RPG, but its a very different one, with no combat and heavy focus on skill checks. Its also a detective story, that feels amazing to slowly unravel until you finally solve the case. If you want to try it, Ill give you three advices- Dont look for spoilers, be a real detective.- Dont metagame or reload if you fail a check, live with the consequences of your choices.- Dont skip text. If you are tired of reading, stop and play again another day.While Disco Elysium has some replay value, its all about the first playthrough. Dont spoil it and enjoy the ride. you can spend the entire game saying the most communist thing possible in every single dialogue, read communist books, show sympathy for the revolution, etc. and when you finally meet the most communist person in the game he just calls you a liberal Great game, sail the seas. The people who actually made this game got pushed out. This game was stolen from the creators, dont buy it and help fund their theft. Find different ways to experience it This is probably the game that touched me the most in my entire life.After a certain age, the fascination and surprise for things tends to decrease. I see my nephews completely hallucinating about some new Marvel movie and I remember my young self watching Lord of the Rings for the first time. That sense of surprise, wonder, excitement I swore had been lost.Until I came across this game.It is a game that subverts the idea of winning, that reinvents a genre, that creates a new art, finally reading it in the form of a game in its definitive form.But its not for everyone. It is a game for those who like to read, for those who want to read. Maybe it doesnt really bring the adrenaline and action that some expect in a video game, but it does bring a very audacious depth of reflection that has translated better into game format than any media. A Disco Elysium book wouldnt make the same sense.Immortal Game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME HEREThis game was stolen from the original devs, they no longer make any money off this gameInstead, acquire it through other means, get creative With that out of the way, this game is 1010. A fantastic experience that I would recommend to anyone So only played 90 minutes but Im already floored.Look every time a game has the choices matter tag on steam I put this to test. So I play for an hour, then restart the game and look how much deviation and choices matter there actually is. And where most games fail in this regard, this game fucking nails it. So I did two quick test runs, with two completely different charactes, and while the dialogue beats are, of course, mostly the same, the way you get to them is so ridiculously tailored to your character you would think the game is actually written for the character you create in the beginning. Never ever in 25 years of gaming did I encounter this feeling of a game respecting my character with the depth and intricacies as this does. Im in awe.Edit 5 hours in. I actually had to start a new save. Not because of a bug or Im at a dead end or something like that but because my character became such an asshole through my choices hey I wanted to test the extremes, you know that I cant identify with him anymore, and even feel repulsed by him if this make any sense, lol. What an awesome game. Which other game even challenges you like that?Final edit is coming after I beat this game.If some dev is reading this I do have some minor quibbles though- For the love of god dont cloud sync the game settings. My laptop for work is a potato compared to my at-home-gaming-rig and its a pita to always have to change my settings if I switch pcs.- It would be awesome if you could not only up a skill when you level up, but be able to reduce the point of a skill as well for people not playing the game already There can be downsides if you are too good with a skill. Like how you can be too empathic or too logical in real life to the point people think youre a weirdo. Would make room for more build diversity. I dont particularly agree that if you want to play a master of logical deduction you have to be some kind of a drama queen as well. A common thread among critics has been that Disco Elysium is the kind of game were going to talk about as the turning point of an epoch -- that its so influential were going to talk about what games were before Disco Elysium and how theyre different after it. And thats really how it ought to be, but Im skeptical that well see it happen, because the thing that makes Disco Elysium so special isnt some easy-to-reproduce aspect in its systems its the writing. And writing a game as brilliant as this has always been an option, albeit one few games are going to live up to. The systems are neat, the clownish dressup minigame to solve puzzles is something one could duplicate, etc., but Disco Elysium lives and dies by its writing, and thats not something everyone can just easily copy to create a new milieu of adventure RPGs.Its wickedly funny and achingly sad in equal measure, a combination that probably wont lend itself to your average dragon-killing story or similar to come down the line. Its a game that wears politics -- not necessarily your politics or someone elses, but politics in general -- on its sleeve and is extremely sympathetic to people while viciously criticizing any given sector of belief. Disco Elysium is, for example, far too familiar with the communist worldview not to have the sympathies of its writers, but is also the most vicious and valid criticism of communist ideology Ive ever seen. Its equally merciless to any of its would-be competitors.  Its a game thats tender and sympathetic to its characters and positively ruthless to everything they believe in.All of this is to say that Disco Elysium is the kind of achievement that deserves to be spoken of as a turning point in adventureRPG games, but it didnt get there through some novelty of system. Whether we see more of its ilk is a question of whether developers and publishers show as much courage as it took to create this game in the first place. It is not a game, it is an experience. A very special one and totally unique. And it can be the best one you had in a lifetime of gaming.I have finally reached a THOUSAND HOURS playing this game. So I guess it is time for me to review it. Every viable choice and path, different interactions, probably saw all the dialogues, I dare to say. I really did everything possible, researched all the alternatives, even explored the most grim and absurd outcomes, just to see how far your freedom goes. I did it all. And it really gives you the most absurd amount of choices and risks to take. All the perfect choices, and all the wrong ones on purpose. And usually, there is no wrong path to take. What kind of cop do you want to be?Disco Elysium gave us all hope, the genre of the CRPGs may not be dead yet. The level of the narrative is outstanding, the quality of this writing I never saw in a game before. The artstyle is mesmerizing, has its unique flair and it confer more char personality, and those characters really make you feel something, they go beyond archetypes and simple conflicts, they have pasts, souls and internal struggles. So does the city in ruins, an eternal reminder of mankinds brutality.  You may be surprised how deep and complex the characters can be. Always unexpected, they can make you laugh, really cry and hate them, at once. And it the thought cabinet mechanic utilized were genius, it viabilize the elaboration of a quirky persona, as well as your rebelous self-conscious personality traits that can manifest themselves whenever they see fit. Your feelings and instincts may step in with their opinions, but so can your Horrific Ugly Necktie. Take them seriously its up to you.The plot and and the politicial context has social sensibility, subtle criticism to EVERY kinda of ideology or political alignment and you can choose whichever you want, you can even choose multiple and lie to the different people. It satisfies everyone. It mocks all the shortcomings of any position in smart ways as well, while not losing it seriousness and still delve into deep philosophycal questions. It really raises a lot of ethical dilemmas. Of course, you can ignore most of that and dedicate yourself to drug addiction and alcooholism too. Whatever you decide, the adventure is always UNIQUE and will be a different journey to everyone. The important think is never choose anything that would cramp your style.As I said, it is not a game, it is an experience. Unique for each person. One that really changed my life and my perspectives, I am really grateful for all the time I have put into this.And I really look forward to the future of ZAUM Studio. STEAM  - You hover your mouse over the Add to Cart option of the store page1.  Purchase the heavily discounted game2.  STEAM  - The game now sits in your Steam Library, eagerly waiting to be binged to completion VOLITION   - Do not spend 40 hours playing this game. CONCEPTUALISATION   - Even if it is a work of visual art. DRAMA   - With excellent characters. ENCYCLOPEDIA   - And pseudo-historical political commentary. SHIVERS   - Topped off by an impending sense of dread. HORRIFIC NECKTIE  - JUST PLAY THE DAMN GAME! QUIT YOUR JOB. STOP CLEANING THE HOUSE. THOSE ARE ALL RESPONSIBILITIES. YOU DONT LIKE THOSE. PAIN THRESHOLD   - Just play the game you poverty stricken fuck. ZAUM is run by a scumbag of a CEO whom i wish all the worst, but the game itself was made by talented and passionate people whole pour their souls and love into it and it shows If you let it, this game could tell you an amazing detective story.Or tell you a thought-through history of a unique world.Or drag you into unending arguements with yourself, usually spiraling into despair and self-loathing.Or leaving you wordless as you observe a dramatic scene to masterfully written soundtrack.This is art, folks. One of the best games I have played in years. Dont buy this game My favorite take on roleplaying games so far. The world is incredibly rich and always two levels deeper than what meets the eye. Narration is done in a way, that I have never seen before, taking advantage of the medium. The amound of writing fully voiced, mind you is simply insane, the art stunning, the possibilities for player expression are insane, while providing a sensible amount of agency.   The only sour thing about the game is the takeover of the company, replacing local Estonian writers with Anglophone ones, getting rid of anyone oppising to the new capital overlords and seeking profit maximisation, going as far as to film a show for Amazon, which is in such gross and stark opposition to the games core message, that I can not recommend anyone to pay for this game  As Joyce Messier say in the game  Thats how simple it is. One may dye their hair green, and wear their grandmas coat all they want. Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would critique capital end up reinfircing it instead... A real masterpiece, a true work of art we will never see again due to some slimy business men taking over the studio. The game is worth experiencing, without a doubt, but do not give your money to these thieves who hijacked the studio. Disco Elysium is an unusual game. There is no other game like it. It takes you to places youve never been to before and lets you go through unusual experiences. It puts you in the shoes of a detective tasked with solving a murder. An unstable, addicted, loser detective. Or a rather sane, boring detective. Its up to you. The game gives you the freedom to take your character in whatever direction you want and for the endgame it doesnt really matter. Its an RPG, but dont worry about stats, or which path to take. There is no right or most effective way to play Disco Elysium. You play this game to experience the story and the strange moments. In that way, its not unlike the adventure games of old like the ones made by Sierra or LucasArts. Youll spend most of the game talking to people and exploring... and thats really about it. Combat is not a significant part of the game at all. Chatting with a stranger and passing a few checks can get you very far. Leave your guns or spells at home.Youve probably read that Disco Elysium involves a lot of reading. Its true. Reading and choosing dialogue is 90 of what youll do. That and running around, sometimes aimlessly. Now, if that makes you lose your interest rather quickly, then this game is not for you. Indeed, its not fast-paced and thats not a bad thing if youre looking for something a little different. Its not Slow Boil The Game, because that award goes to Else Heart.Break, but it gets close sometimes.And thats where my biggest criticism lies. The pace is too slow sometimes. Im under the impression that the developers have relied on the games writing which is terrific and amazing! a bit too much. Its an RPG, why not let players explore new areas a bit more? Or at least a bit sooner? New areas open up very slowly and are gated behind major story advancements. Expect to travel between A and B a lot before C and D even appear on the horizon. The same applies to the dialogue. Youll spend a lot of time talking to the same characters over and over again before someone new gets introduced. Im fine with reading a lot, but especially during the middle part of the story I really wanted the game to pick up the unnecessarily slow pace. A few times I had to load an older save because the devs clearly expected me to do X, and I didnt do X, and that resulted in me following a dead end. An example would be and this is not really a spoiler me not being able to sleep anywhere and thus not advancing the story because I chose not to accept a certain characters money offer, and thus I couldnt afford the hotel room. Yes, you can spend a lot of time collecting tar and searching every nook and cranny for a few pennies here and there, but come on... you are the Hobo Cop. Look at the way the developers present their protagonist. Surely he should be able to sleep on a bench at night! So just so you know in advance, when that someone offers you money, just accept it. Youll save yourself a lot of trouble.There are a few other ways the game gets artificially lengthened. I wish it was possible to save anywhere, including during the games many dialogue scenes. If you have to leave and stop playing while talking to a character, next time you play youll be reverted to the most recent save before that talk, which can be annoying because you have to go through the lengthy dialogue again. Of course this time you wont have to finish the voice acting and read everything again, but still. Let the player save anywhere. Another strange thing that happened to me a lot was 95 checks failing quite regularly. That can happen, but it happened suspiciously often. Perhaps theres something going on under the hood thats hidden from the player, or maybe Im imagining things. Either way, it made me want to reload a save a few times to redo a check.Most professional game journalists never mention these things in their reviews. Instead they go on and on about their GOTY nominations, always gushing over this years dearest game in 15 articles spanning several weeks, but rarely covering the glaringly obvious negative aspects. Thats great publicity for the developer, but not very useful for gamers who want to buy a nice game with their hard-earned money. Thats why I felt compelled to go against the grain a bit and deliver a slightly different message.Disco Elysium still is an amazing game. The writing is superb and on another level. The art is unique and atmospheric. The characters are great. The city is great. Revachol breathes character, just like Thiefs the City. If youre looking for a game that almost plays like youre reading a book, a game to relax with, a world that sucks you in, then you should definitely buy this game. It may not line up with your expectations entirely, but youll have a good time and its a great experience. During the games later stages the pace will pick up a bit and the ending doesnt disappoint.Heres to many more succesful titles from ZAUM! Lets start with the simple. Disco Elysium is my GOTY, GO5Y game of the recent five years, and the spiritual successor to Planescape Torment Ive been waiting for for twenty years. Its THAT good, unapologetically. If you can even conceive of touching a game of this genre, buy it.This is an isometric RPG without fighting so closee to an adventure, really, with a very heavy emphasis on the plot, so if youre strictly opposed to doing much reading, it wont be your cup of tea. However, if youre only mildly opposed to reading in games, Id still suggest you give it a try. The writing is very good succinct, dynamic, engaging, with no purple prose and irrelevant walls of lore. It begins as a sort of Planescape Torment parody with the main character getting amnesia from drinking, yet at the same time the weird and existential aspects of the story also shine immediately. In other words, the beginning is very strong try the game, and in the first hour youll see for yourself if it grabs you or not.The presentation is beautiful, the games style both gentle and a bit creepy. The UI is slick, the music sad and unintrusive. Its all niceand not the reason were here.The reason is the story. As a narrative designer myself, I cant for the love of me imagine how theyve done it. Good writing demands empathygetting in the shoes of every character you create, even when theyre not nice people. Good reactive video game narratives demand logic and structural thinkingcreating a text that is in a flux, knowing that the player will only see parts of it depending on their skills and choices and making sure each variant is good and interesting. The absolute majority of games, even story-based, only deliver one aspect you either get a deep, memorable, but linear story SOMA, The Last of Us or a very reactive story made flexible by the fact that everyone is relatively shallow, so while you can influence a lot of things, you dont care deeply about any Divinity Original Sin 2. Even the story of Planescape Torment was kinda modulara lot of smaller characters and stories were only there to be there and add flavor to the world.And then you have Disco Elysium. While its main story has certain fixed beats, you can approach every situationevery situation, I repeatin a number of very different ways, depending on what skills you choose. At the early stages it can almost feel like playing different games. You can make big choices.More importantly though, in my 36 hours of playing, I havent encountered a single instance of video game stupidity, like the game gating me from logical actions just because Ive done some things out of expected orderwhich I certainly have I only got the body down from the tree on Day 3, for example. This is not because you can do anything in this game, but rather because it excels at manipulating you to want to do the things it allows. The lengths the developers went to to make sure Disco Elysium plays smooth, like a real-life LARP, is insane. You might not even notice itthe moments when small remarks, like as I already told you or didnt you mean something else when you asked X before?, are injected into the NPCs dialogue, making it flow. These are small things, but they make conversations sould like actual long conversations instead of bunches of informations dispersed to you.And boy, what conversations those are. Funny, interesting, genuinely intellectual, absurd, touching... theres no filler dialogue in the game, no filler charactersevery single person serves a narrative purpose, everyones story or situation comes into play in some way. The fates of people get intertwined, making you come back to them again and again, digging deeper and deeper, discovering new facets of their personalities. Disco Elysium uses its arguably-realistic setting to set character hooksstart off with relatable and easily recognizable real-life problems. Weve all met weird people like cryptozoology enthusiasts, drunken artists, communist nutsos or esoteric-minded ladies, we recognize the types and thus get engrossed in their storiesthus getting attached. Yet, even though the quests are intertwined, most are also strong stories on their own, with different moods and styles.Delivering the news to that woman was one of the hardest things Ive ever done in video games, and I play Dark Souls a lot.I cant remember the last time Ive changed my opinion of video game characters several times over the course of a playthough. I cant remember the last time I had to pause the game and seriously consider what choice to make. Im STILL not sure what to think if Klaasje.I cant remember the last time a game would allow me to play as Karl Marx I mean Kras Mazov, but, yknow reincarnated. Or imagine the nothingness where all that exists is the swallowing motion in a human throat. Or make a truly HARD-CORE beat by finding a 2-mm hole in reality.Its this mixture of tones and styles that makes Disco Elysium transcendent.full ending spoilers ...Which is why I was so baffled by who the killer turned out to be. You do not introduce the killer in the final act of a crime story. Its like the basic rule of writing whoddunits. And I just cant believe this games writers, who showed incredible skill with everything else, made this blunder by mistake... yet I cant understand this choice. It makes sense in that it gives a narrative purpose to all the background history stories in the end, we did have a reason to get to know who the communists were and why the Revolution happened, because thats what ended up motivating the killer. But... you spend 30 hours forging our emotional connections with a huge cast of characters, making us feel for all kinds of people, and then throw a completely new character at us, that we have no connection to, who has no associates in the town and in the end is just a damaged psycho?I dont understand this choice and would be happy if someone explained it to me.Still, perfect games do not exist. The walking speed in Disco Elysium is torturous and the pathfinding is often painful. It gets annoying to change your clothes each time before a skill check, and the game basically invites you to save-scum.Those downsides are bearable, compared to the sad and hilarious story of our detective, his partner Kim Kitsuragi, by-the-book yet not cheerless, and this odd backwards corner of the world with its odd backwards politics, drama, love, and insanity.And a talking necktie.GOTY.P. S. The reply font comes directly from Planescape Tormentthe shape, the color. Its small and superfluous, but still made me warm and fuzzy a bit. Finished this game last night with wet eyes and a racing heart. Totally blown away. I do a lot of tabletop roleplaying and improv comedy and when our group is having the most fun, its when we are playing our characters honestly, not trying to go for an easy joke or trying to power game, but being vulnerable even at our characters detriment. Our game master bless his heart encourages our vulnerability and truth and finds way to reward us for these self imposed obstacles. Its about failing, and hopefully failing upwards. Disco Elysium feels like the first game that I have played that truly embodies this spirit. The main character, your partner who I would die for, the larger ensemble, the town you are in, and even the world the game is set in are all failing. The game is a rube goldberg  machine of failure. Within this games labyrinth of failure and loss, there is beauty, redemption, and moments that made me laugh out loud to myself. I failed skilled checks and ended up ahead because of it, sometimes literally. You grow from your failures, you learn or you dont!, and you do it in a way that ends up feeling unique to your play through. On that note- when Ive been a part of bad tabletop roleplaying sessions, for me, its because our GM or table does things to take away my characters autonomy. This can happen with game masters or groups that want to stick close to the rails of maybe a players handbook, or some sort of pre set GM module. When you, as a player color outside the lines, you are crazy until you get back on the rails and return to the regular scheduled programming. In Disco Elysium, coloring outside the lines are just as valid a play style as any.  It has spoiled me on dialogue options and character customization. You dont create your protagonist from scratch, but you get to customize your characters brain and how and what they think, and Ive found that this is what Ive always wanted from a RPG video game but never knew to ask for.  Your dominant stats which you control and are very varied, ranging from Hand Eye Coordination to Shivers, which is akin to an affinity for out of body visions are personified and provide you council as you play the game, and you discover thoughts which you can then internalize just like real life! to unlock new dialogue options, bonuses and penalties. Its glorious. It really feels like the game sees you. I have no idea how Im supposed to play another role playing game after this one. I want more. Just finished the game after 60 hours of gameplay and I dont really know what I can say to express how ecstatic I feel about this game. The writing is superb and admirable for its sheer scope alone the game world is one of the most interesting fantasy worlds I have seen in a while, and its so densely packed with history and politics that it really feels alive and the art direction is just ... well, it really tickles my Art Cop brain.So instead of continuing to gush over this game, Ill give you some advice instead in case youre also thinking about playing it1 Take your time. Dont just skip through dialogues, really take in all the information you get. The game rewards you for paying attention and saying the right things at the right time. It really helps that, with the Final Cut version at least, the game if fully voiced.2 Keep an open mind. The game bombards you with all sorts of strange ideas from minute one, and it doesnt spend a lot of time explaining these ideas which makes sense given the premise of the game. Take it all in and think about what it all means to you, and I think you can get a lot out of the experience.3 Dont save scum. This one is a bit hypocritical because I ended up doing just that for large portions of my playthrough. But looking back I wish I wouldve done less of it. Failure is a big part of the games narrative and some truly amazing things can come out of you completely messing up a critical skill check. Just learn to let go and see where the game takes you instead of going back and aiming for that perfect outcome. Believe me, there is no perfect outcome.And thats it. I hope this game will bring you as much joy as it did me. - Im 44 and I havent made very much room in my life for games. Work, continuing education, and my hobbies take up most of my free time. Still, I never forgot a game called Planescape Torment that I played back in the late 1990s. I purchased the Enhanced Edition of PST a while ago and played through it again, it was for the most part as wonderful as I remember it being.There was a game released a year or two ago called Torment Tides of Numenera. It was billed as a spiritual sequel to PST, and I found the setting and the characters to be lacking. Distant. Alien for the sake of being alien. The writing was more flowery than it needed to be - it pulled punches when it should have gone for the knock out. I didnt find it to be a complete wash and I played through about 70 percent of it, which is quite good for me because as Ive mentioned I dont make very much room in my life for media consumption.Ive only played Disco Elysium for a few nights and I can say that this is it. This is the spiritual successor to PST and Ive found the writing to be so engaging that I actually considered skipping work on Thursday in order to stay home and play the game.If it came down to a choice between having all of the games currently on my desktop available to me, or having only Disco Elysium available to me, Id select DE. That feeling of course will probably change when I finish the game, or it might take another playthrough or two, but for now its brightened my little corner of existence. Games currently on my desktop- The Witcher 3- Mutant Year Zero- NieR Automata- Deus Ex Mankind Divided- Borderlands 2- Star Wars Battlefront 2- Life is Strange- DiRT Rally- Kingdom Come Deliverance- Aporia Beyond the Valley- Legrand Legacy The first thing you should know about Disco Elysium is that it is a very good game. The second thing you should know about this game is that it is not actually a game, it is in fact a beautifully written choose your own adventure book pretending to be a real game. This may not be the longest game but it is a quality over quantity type of deal. Even if every single line of dialogue isnt a masterpiece it is astounding how many of them are. This game just hits you with an unending set of solid characters, interesting plot developments, and genuinely funny lines. Then the climax and the ending hit me like a school bus full of bricks and I just sat there in my grungy-ass chair, staring at my screen, and watching the credits roll as I reflected on the choices I had made that led me to that ending.TLDR Is gud game, go buy 15 copies of it.",
        "summary": "Disco Elysium is one of the best games Ive ever played. Its an RPG, but its a very different one, with no combat and heavy focus on skill checks. Its also a detective story, that feels amazing to slowly unravel until you finally solve the case."

A group of investorsparasites screwed the minds behind this game, so what you pay for this game is not gonna go to their rightfull owners. the game is good but the original creators got screwed over and kicked out. so if you buy the game then know that it wont support them, only the company that they are no longer a part of. This game is the closest thing to perfect a game can get for me. I had 80 hours on gog before i ever beat the game because i kept restarting to try new things. It never got old and i was always finding new paths i never even considered. There is nothing like Disco Elysium. Too bad the publishers became the very thing this game critiques and gutted the developers for money. I Hope Your tone deaf Amazon tv show crashes and burns.Support the actual devs on their new solo projects like XXX Nightshift This is the best game Ive ever played. The OST, the storyeverything is phenomenal. Its a true masterpiece.But theres a problem Do not support ZAUM. Avoid buying the game, their merchandise, or anything from their atelier. Not a single cent should go to them.One individual wrongfully took control of ZAUM from the original creators. This person needs to be held accountable for what was done to Kurvitz, Rostov, Hindpere, and others. Art should win over greed.In 2021, the creators sold company stakes to a trusted investor to fund the game. This investor was later bought out by two others, leaving the company in untrusted hands. The ringleader, Toni Haavel, has a history of fraud. When Kurvitz and Rostov asked for financial documents, they were fired.Kurvitz and Rostov accuse Haavel of fraud in acquiring the company and are pursuing legal action in both the UK and Estonia.Support the artists, not the exploiters. Let art triumph over greed. !!DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!Disco Elysium is one of the greatest games of all time, and is, perhaps, the best written game of all time. Due to extensive underhanded, but legal, methods, the creators of the game were the victims of a hostile takeover, and no longer receive any of the profits at all from purchasing this game.Thusly, to summarize DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME, and if you do, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. It is frankly priceless, there is no amount of money you could apply to the quality of the game, but the people responsible for this masterpiece have had their work ripped away from them by a greedy, malignant body intent on empowering themselves off of the work of others. There are ways you can play games without paying for them, by the way. Thats all Im going to say on that matter.!!DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!! This is the best video game I have ever played, but under no circumstances should you ever buy it. Have a look at what ZAUM, the developer, is up to these days after purging many of the original creators of this gamehttpsvideogames.si.comnewsdisco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-outAs part of looking into the layoffs yesterday, one source told us that they didnt think women were treated the same and that their work wasnt as valued at ZAUM. We asked if Tuulik had seen these issues at the company as well. Absolutely, he said. Youd have to be blind not to. In the PMG documentary, the former DE Final Cut Lead Writer Helen Hindpere describes a call with the Chief Executive Tnis Haavel, where Tnis is screaming at her. Its so loud that a fellow writer who walks in hears the screaming through her headphones and asks what the fk was that? That writer was me.Dora Klindi broadly echoed Tuuliks sentiment Ive seen good work done at ZAUM. Ive also seen management and production staff terrorizing creatives, lying, playing power games, turning people against each other, destroying relationships and peoples self-esteem. For this, there have been no repercussions.She also emphasized that some workers would not only lose their jobs, but would have to upend their whole lives as a result of the layoffs As a reward for our hard work, some of us are even slated to lose our immigration status in the UK and will have to evacuate the country. We will be gone by next week, but those who remain are grappling with a place irrevocably changed.The mask has slipped from the face of capital. What remains at ZAUM is a cold, careless company where managers wage war against their own creatives, where artistry is second to property, and where corporate strategy is formed by an arrogant disdain for their own audience.Borrow it from a friend or find some other way to play it without giving money to these monsters. Great game, did my research on the new publishers and how they stole the IP and cant recommend this game for purchase.  Find it Elsewhere This is my favorite game. The writing and world building are a cut above the rest. But do not give your money to the people that stole from us the chance for a sequel made by the original developers. Pirate this game. Great game, but if you care about the creators then dont support this. They got stolen out of their IP and one of the developers is begging for money on GoFundMe just to survive The game is 1010, its an absolute masterpiece. However, Im leaving this negative review because I stumbled upon some concerning blog posts years after buying the game. Ill explain why you shouldnt buy the game.The game and the IP were stolen from the original creators and developers, in one of the most unhinged fraud plots Ive ever seen. To summarize it, some fraudster used his girlfriend who worked at the studio to buy some concept art for 1, then turned around and sold that very same content for 5 million dollars to the studio... he then used that money to buy a majority stake from the unsuspecting first investor who wanted out for personal reasons. Naturally, the creators -- who are a minority shareholders at this point-- were deeply concerned by this whole nonsense, and were ultimately pushed out of the company. Insane, right? Some criminals basically stole the money from the studio to buy the studio. In any respectable jurisdiction this scenario would be a textbook fraud case and the perpetrators would be sitting in a jail cell right now. 1010 Game, very HARDCORE010 Greedy ShareholdersPlay it, dont purchase it. Do as you will. While the Game itself is Good, the Company of ZAUM is a disgusting Shell that has forced out the lead creatives of this IP due to unbridled Greed.The Company in its infinite wisdom forced out Its lead writer and creator of the world Robert Kurvitz, effectively stealing his creation from him. This is unironically one of the best RPGs... no, one of the best games Ive ever played and I would genuinely recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in cRPGs. Its a brilliantly written and very political detective story that is able to re-shape massively to your actions.However, the reason why this is a negative review is because there is some very odd business occurring at ZAUM that has resulted in the creators of the game being placed away from the game they have made.The situation is quite complicated so I recommend looking into it yourself, and making your own judgements.In the meantime, I urge you to hold off buying this game on Steam and try alternative ways of obtaining this game. A cynical and beautiful and hilarious and heart-wrenching game with no flaws but its management. Dont support this game, dont spend money on it but play it in whatever way you can. The creative minds behind this game will not get compensated if you pay for this game, only the greedy studio will. I love this game one of the best games ever, but I cannot support the company. Do not buy this game... especially at full price. If you were to get it some other way however, it is definetly worth your time. Game itself? Very Disco, very good.  1110, one of best if not best stories in games I have playedMeans of capital as CEO of ZAUM destiny studio and stabbing creators of world and game in their backs? Not very Disco. Dont buy a game if you want to support its creators ZAUM forced the creative minds behind this game out of the company do not give them your money.Its a fantastic game, though! If only there were some way of getting it without paying those thieves for it. If only",
        "summary": "The game was stolen from its origional creators by people defrauding company funds to buy a controlling share and then booting the people who actually made this. Do not buy the game, do not buy ZAUMs merch, clothes in their atelier, anything! Not a single euro cent should go to their greedy hands. Buy from shared resources do not give this thing wearing  Zaums corpse money."

I told her no. A few hours later the Mayor calls me and tells me they will cut my budget and I have to fire one officer. I told the drunk officer that shell have to quit at the end of the day, but not before going out on one last mission. On the way there she had a car accident and died, because she was drunk driving.1010 An officer May i take the day off work today to attend my fathers funeral?Me Ye- wait what. checks my officers listHis father is also a policeman and hes already checked in at work for todayMe You little lying BestExcuses1010 THIS IS THE POLICE REVIEWNow, I know Im not a player with hundreds of hours on record, but i am quite a fair way into the game.Rather than go through the pros and cons  I would like to share one of my experiences that I feel best sums up my time with This Is The Police so far.It was a rather slow, mundane day and no big crimes were happening. I recieved a report that there were vandals at the mall. not too difficult I thought to myself. I looked through my heavily depleted roster and saw jim. My favourite officer. He was only a lowly 5 rated officer bear in mind my best was 300 aged 70 who really in reality should have been in a retirement home. I always intended to give him the proper send off, a retirement with valour. Well, that never came to be. He pulled up at the scene to try and get the vandals to stop. Instead of pulling out paint cans, they pulled out a knife and held Jim against his will. I sent in a swat team to try to save Jim in the nick of time. The youths didnt give Jim a second thought and cut his throat where he stood. To make matters worse, the mafia were hounding me for answers as to why I sent an officer to their meet up. I had forgotten that where I sent Jim in to had actually been set up long before and I had promised the mafia that I wouldnt interfere. The perpetrators escaped, leaving Jim on the floor to die. I was sat in my office slow jazz music blasting out around me as I mourned the deaths of one of my favourite men, not because he was a good officer, but because he wasnt. He was the worst officer I had but he was the one I cared about the most. A few days later I recieved a message from city hall regarding his funeral Today it read is a sad day. Today we loose a man of the city. God bless Jim  I felt a strange feeling, one of both pride at the atknowledgement of his service and of loss and pain at the passing of one of my favourite men. Memories of when he asked to take the day off because he couldnt sleep and when he asked for time off as it was his cats birthday. Very few games make me feel this way. Jim was a procedurally generated character who created his own stories that created an impression on me. I love this game and the stories it creates. Before I go shaking my tits for the press, Id like to go see how the professionals do it.Intro video immediately catches your attention, with its simplistic yet effective art style. Experienced Police Chief of Freeburg, Jack Boyd starts talking about the safest place to hang out in the city with his thick, rasp voice. His tip money for services walk around the restaurant, exchanging hands as he talks about manners. You feel -oh, this is going to be one of them cop games. After you do shake your tits for the press, you get the grasp of what the situation is, who the big dogs are in the town - slowly. In your first few days, you will learn about the corrupt officials, gangs, your own staffs performance. One of your officers show up to work drunk - tough luck, youre already understaffed and you have to try to keep this small noir city on its feet. Yet, as you start to adapt and learn what a sht nest of a place Freeburg is - surrounded by a dark and dank N.Y.C. detective novel cloud, youre shrouded with experience and the ropes of the job. Responding to calls while you put your favorite jazz record to the player. Days come and go, investigations are solved, you improve your officers. Rain starts and curtains are dropped every day at 6 p.m while jazz record fills your ears.You will consider, many times, what it is to be a good cop or a bad cop - let me explain this. Game pushes you to think through it. Do you want to fill your pockets with illegal money before retiring? Or do you want to stay legit? The game doesnt force you to do anything, gives you the info about the consequeunces of your possible actions, then youre on your own. As you catch up to the experience level of the old Jack Boyds police work, these ethical dilemmas will start hitting you harder. Do you really want to supress that LGBT  black right activists using force, because the mayor is constantly yanking your chain? Or do you let them express their view? Which is right  wrong? What is your mission as a cop? Remember, the City Hall is paying your salary, but - are you going to serve and protect and risk losing half of your salary? Or choose to make the citizens suffer, the ones that you sworn to protect? Are you going to take the help of the mafia, do their bidding and get some sweet greens on the side? As your ethical standarts start to crumble under the pressure, the game throws you everything its got. Its never boring. Theres always another riot to suppress, another killer on the loose, another power play that turns the city into a warzone, another possible dead officer because you had to send them half cocked to a call... There are so many gray choices throughout the game, but the question is, what side of the gray you will stay in? Or at least try to?Step into the shoes of Police Chief Jack Boyd, see Freeburg as he sees it, contribute with your choices and finish this game. Help him get through his last 180 days before retirement. Do your best OR your worst. You ARE Jack Boyd now, its your rodeo. I wish steam had a neutral option.Warning for light spoilers?I liked this game quite a lot, up until the ending. The art style is nice, and the premise of the game is interesting. You manage a police station and send your cops out to calls. You also manage a crew of detectives who solve more complex crimes. The detective cases are fun when youre not frustrated by unclear frames. you can earn your money honestly by relying on your paycheck and taking down gangs, or through other more questionable means. The story is engaging, if a little drawn out by the send your cops out every damn day sequences. Also way too many people show up drunk to work, like, on a roster of 20 cops, 5 will show up drunk. I woudlve fired them if not for the fact that Id rather not trade a lv 500 cop for a lv 100 newbie. I think an improvement would be that your potential recruits increase in lvl the longer into the game you are, so its not a complete loss to get rid of lazy or drunken cops.Since the game prides itself on making choices that matter, it fails spectacularly. The game can end in one of four ways Shot dead prematurely, or put in jail, and the two endings you can get for making it the full 180 days. Calling it two endings because the only difference is whether you met your money goal, which only makes a single frame of difference in the ending cutscene. Its still shit. Theres no reward for being an honest cop and taking down gangs, theres no reward for being corrupt either. It doesnt matter.And in a game like this, the worst damn thing is for your choices not to matter.The ending wouldve probably worked better if the game was a visual novel. Great concept, great story and great base game.However your enjoyment will depend on how well you handle the bunch of small issues the game comes packaged with.You play the story of police Chief Jack Boyd and the game alternates between storytelling cutscenes occasionally allowing a choice and the main portion of the game where you manage a citys police station while trying to make some retirement money on the side.The sim portion is great, the game lets you make moral choices not by directly asking you but by throwing quests at you from the interested parties and purposely failing them is a legit way of refusing an assignment you might consider dangerous or immoral. Of course in such a case you have to face the consequences.The noirish theme tells the story of a retiring police chief whos life is falling apart as he is pressured from multiple sides and dealing with obstacles that prevent him from doing his job properly. The main character is portrayed as very much morally gray with Jack having no qualms to behave like a jerk at times. On the other hand just how bad he is, is left up to the player in the sim portions of the game. A huge criticism has been that it is impossible to stay 100 idealistic police chief and that is true, but you can most definitely be up there in the 80-90 goodguy.As mentioned earlier the base game is great but small issues can make it frustrating to some people, I had a blast but I suspect others might feel the game drags on too much in the mid portion, that there are small quality-of-life improvements that are missing like ability to call officers from another shift mid day when youre suddenly short-staffed. Oh and the ending leaves many unsatisfied and I can see why, but I suppose its just that kind of story.Buy at a discount or research before buying. I give my recommendation as I enjoyed the game through to the end. This game has lots going for it but it suffers because players lack the ability to control the pacing. There are moments in this game you wish you could fast forward or speed up. The developers seem to want to keep control of how you experience this game throughout but this becomes annoying and terribly frustrating. Want to play a management game? Let me mess it up for you and show youre not in control. Want to follow the story? Let me play it to you in snippets you cant revisit if you forget anything over 16 hours of play. At some point, you just want to give up.There are very interesting mechanics in this game e.g. investigations but at the same time there are aspects of these same mechanics that are truly frustrating like needing the lead investigator for the arrest who might be on a different shift.I would recommend this game as an experience as this game is unique in many ways and I wish there were more games like this. There is a lot of love poured into this game and it shows. There are even mini-games here thrown in.. although they come as a total surprise so you would easily fail it as soon as it appears.This is a game that showed potential but ultimately failed to become one of the greats. Ive given up on finishing this game. Its a good game that resembles a game that I would like, but I dont think the game is for me.I like the concept of the game. I bought it quite a few years ago where story sim games like this one were quite rare. You send cops on missions as you assess the situation. Pretty fun! You get a typical noir story with rich atmosphere.Now heres what I dont like 1. there is too little story for my liking - long dozen day streaks where there is no main plot. Or I suppose, too little reading as well? 2. Gameplay loop gets boring once you get past the initial hurdles. Once you amass enough manpowerpolice staff, the game loses all challenge and become somewhat repetitive.I stopped around the ninety day mark because I kept losing interest, unable to push myself to continue. Its honestly a good game, but I dont think its for me. Now that there exists amazing games like Suzerain and such, I think I would rather spend my time elsewhere. But if police chief sim in noir setting is what you would like, Id say go for it! Play as Police Chief getting ready to retire in a couple of yearsDecide to play ultra-good copRefuse to work with the MafiaBust their goons every time they make a moveIdiot Mafia leader lets me know hes committing crimes ahead of timeTries to bribe me to not send any police but I send some anywayLess than two weeks into the gameShot dead in my own homeGame overtfw pay the ultimate price in the name of serving Justice I think your degree of enjoment in this game will directly depend on how deeply you get immersed into the role of police chief Jack Boyd. Personally I absolutely love it and I think its at least worth your time to buy it and try it, give it two hours and if youre not sure you want to go on then probably refund it and maybe wait for a sale. The game is somewhat frontloaded in content, theres a bit more good stuff early on, but if you like what you see in those first two hours Im fairly certain youd find the game worth the money. for me its a 910- there are some mechanical shortcomings and sometimes you end up having to replay quite long stretches because the instructions simply werent clear enough, or because the solution to a case simply doesnt make sense although this is very rare. But what carries the game is the atmosphere, the writing and quite frankly the feeling that it gives a real sense of what it might be like to be police chief. Just recently for me the department received two essentially simultaneous alarms- one from a janitor at city hall who suspects a visitor of preparing a bomb, and the other from a car dealer where an armed robbery is most definitely going on and where there are already wounded. So what do you do? Its unlikely that the robbery will turn into a massacre, thats not what the robbers want, they would prefer to leave in a couple of luxury cars and be done with it. The bomb threat, if real, will most certainly lead to great loss of life unless you respond ASAP but really its quite hard to say if theres anything actually going on at city hall at all. So what did I do? I went for the bomb threat. What decided it? Two things- first of all theres a known criminal on the loose who could certainly commit such a crime, and second the fact that the bomb will hit city hall probably means that if I let it go the mayor will have my head- that is to say- he will gut the department to make me look bad and try to ruin my life. Hes just that kind of a guy. This will mean that there will be even more call ins that I cant respond to, as I simply wont have the money to pay for enough officers to adequately protect the city. It is clear to me that there is greater risk of casualties at the robbery as the bomb threat is likely not real, but if the bomb threat is real it will be greater loss of life both in the short term And in the long term as the mayor responds. With a known psychopath with strange political motives on the move I decide that Freeburg will just have to take the hit at the car dealership. So what happened?Well.The threat wasnt real.The janitor was just jumpy. What next?Try to get a good nights sleep, as the circus will just keep going first thing in the morning.That and dont go to the bottle.God damn I love this game. This is a very difficult game to review. I wish I could give a sideways thumb, but here goes..... The Good  For 15, you get 20-25 hours of gameplay, for some people, this alone makes the game worth it. The management system is very fun, I dont mind a little bit of RNG, so random officer deaths or not getting frames never bothered me. Just added to the fun I was having. Storyline and characters are mastertful, top-notch voice acting Juggling the different factions while maintaining a happy police force is really where the game shines late mid game or early late game The Bad  Game is completely linear. The pop-ups are exactly the same every time. So there is no replayability becuase after one playthrough, or if you get shot and need to reload, you know which calls are fake, which are serious, etc. You have a ton of options that never really need to be useddont matter. Paying cops to change politcal views, or sending them to a BBQ, it really doesnt matter.  The Ugly  Your choices dont matter. At all. Supporting one candidate doesnt matter. Getting 500,000 doesnt matter. The characters in the story dont matter. You are presented 3-4 times in the game with choices that seem like the are going to have a major altering effect on the story, ending, and gameplay. They do not.  No replayability. Because the ending doesnt matter, and the pop-ups are the same, the game is very on-rails. If I could have one wish for this game, have an endless mode with random pop-ups and see how long you last as it gets progressively more difficult. The storyline. Its so good. And then....people just disappear or dont matter anymore. Its really disappointing. For a game that did such a masterful job in getting an attachment to characters and building a story, it just kind of.......poofed at the end. In conclusion, for me, who loves management sims, I got my monies worth, even though I am disappointed in the ending. Others will take more of an issue with the ending where a superb game 80 of the way just falls completely on its face the last 20. If you like management, get it, but dont get to invested in the story or characters. One playthrough from start to finish lasts 18 hours, definetely worth the price paid 7,50 myself.Great storyline, atmosphere and crimes that keep updating and keep requiring attention for small hints.Time to start my second playthrough No, you did not lose all of your officers because you had bad RNG. Each call has a set profession threshold which even tells you at the beginning of the game! that must be met or your officers will to an extent die, fail, and get civilians killed.No, the game is not thinned out poorly due to bad game design. It was articulated into a way that Makes you feel like Jack Boyd Chief of Police in a city of idiots and corrupt officials -IGN. You have a job that at the end of the day you will need to complete at long lengths of time. This game requires your patience and will spit it back at you.No, you dont need to only select 1-2 favors from the Mayors Office. As long as you have positive reputation, which is even highlighted for you at the beginning of each day following the start of Act II, you can ask for everything.No, the game does not force you to be a certain way. At the end of the day, you have the choice to go against everyone and everything to try to save whatever moral point of view you have. The question is how long until you realize that Jack Boyd is not as honorable as you are trying to be, and how others try to exploit your good nature.This is a story driven game that does not hold your hand and will bait you constantly with ill-will. It encourages you to use your knowledge of what rules it inhibits and how well you can adapt with risks. Try to play safe and you will realize youre lacking behind with officers and have a force too weak to answer calls, eventually causing you to fail directly when your saving grave officers die and become irreplaceable. Try to be too reckless and youll actually think the radical unprofessional options are fine to roll with, creating a situation where officers are more fodder than established reliable faces you can relate to.When youre done at the end of the day listening to Sweet Ginger Green and other amazing tracks with the longevity mindset, only then youll enjoy the game and understand what it means to be Jack Boyd. After 18 hours of gameplay and story investment I can safely say, this is one of the better games Ive played. With its blues soundtrack, and some other genres, followed with its story and voice acting, it is simply one of the better works of art Ive had the pleasure of spending 15 on. I am, personally, a big fan of time and resource management games with certain LifeDeath scenarios, that ultimately affect the story. The story. I cant stress the story enough. Its just too good to explain. I can, however, condense it into one word. Unforgettable.I rate this game 1010. Though, people who love graphics could rate it lower. Im not one to care for style. After finishing the main storyline of this game and playing it for 29 hours, I am incredibly torn on this game. I love it, and yet, theres some parts of it that really bother me. Ahead may be some spoilers, but I will try to put those in between tags.Lets talk core gameplay loop first. There are so many cases you will send officers to and many you will get through through simple math which the game explains to you very early on. This is the basis, but the game offers many distractions. The community will come calling, as will city hall and eventually, bad guys in multiple different shapes. This will eventually get incredibly hectic, which I experienced as fun. Theres a detective and one other minigame where you try to piece together the cases frame by frame and I simply loved it to pieces.Secondly, lets talk sound design. This game stuck to a lot of basic simple sounds, which are used very efficiently. Whenever I would finish a case, I would hear the clicking of the handcuffs, which would give me the visceral enjoyment of a job well done. Alternatively, I would hear the padding footsteps of a criminal getting away, or the shots of police or innocents dying and I would feel with it. Simple, yet effective. You may also elect to play jazz or blues style music. As a fan of this genre of music, that added a lot. At one point, I was finishing up 3 detective cases in one day and hearing the tones of classical music as my police cars sped away to pick up crims was just an amazing experience.So far so good, and no spoilers yet. So lets get to the most sensitive part of this, the story. I had varying amounts of feeling with this story. From sympathy, to outrage, to simple disappointment. First off, I want to submit that the story is well written and presented well with good voice acting. Its piled on a little heavy at the start of the game, but the mid and late sections of the game make up for it. Topics like discrimination, stress, addiction and all kinds of dark topics are explored in a serious way, which was fantastic. However, to explain what I didnt like, I will have to dive into spoiler territory, so if you do not want to read that, do not mouse over and simply understand I hate the illusion of choice.Fairly early on in the game, you get a choice to help Kendrick escape the mafia by becoming their pawn. Since it was explained that his wife and child were at risk as well and Jack considers him a friend, I elected to help, willingly entering a contract with the mafia. However, when I screwed up a playthrough early on I went back and declined. Guess what? Youre still becoming a mafia pawn. So, I went back, did it over, became the pawn willingly so Kendrick could live. Didnt make a difference anyway. However, this keeps happening. Yes, you are able to later go back and nail the whole mafia, but that didnt do much to still the sour feelings I got from that initial exchange. Lets break the story into three sections, divided by a time skip period.I call the first section Vanilla Jack, when everyone is out to screw you and things get worse every freaking second. I didnt mind much at this point, since the game was just mounting the challenge I was going to face. And face it I was. The second section is after a time skip that happens following a story event where Jack gets knocked into a coma. I call this the Midlife Jack section, where Jack completely embraces corruption and gets all kinds of fancy upgrades. Things get increasingly worse even in this section, mainly because of Jacks own attitude to things at this point. Still, I enjoyed it, after all, who doesnt like a good redemption story, right? The third section then, was to be my Redemption Jack, where Jack goes back to his old roots, being a good old policeman. He starts off this section by kicking ass, and having to face up to this incredible evilness that has been building up. He does so and - dont read the next bit if you dont want the ending spoiled he loses everything. Everything he worked for. Everything you as a player worked very hard for. You walk away with nothing substantial.All in all, I recommend this game for the simple core mechanics, music, and good initial story telling. I do not agree to some story choices the developerswriters made, but perhaps I am simply misunderstanding the genre. This is genuinely one of my favourite management games because it requires you to be a bit strategic with your mangement of the officers at your disposal. Anyhow. You are Jack Boyd, Freeburgs police chief and City hall plans to remove you at the end of tenure as the mayor plans to put his son in charge. You have a 100 days to get a retirement fund and bounce. How will you make it happen? It falls short on a few things such as it being a very very long game that could take up to 20 hours if not more but its filled with many suprising quests and other choices that do matter to the story. 710, Would play again if i had so much patience and time. A singleplayer management game that focuses on a police chiefs final 180 days running his department. Many events will unfold as you play through the story and there are impactful decisions to be made. Will you maintain a pure heart and protect and serve as expected, or will you fall into the hands of corruption.As of 8.3 hours playtime-ProsOriginal game conceptGreat story lineInteresting charactersGreat voice actingGood looking UI and game designConsSome elements of the game get repetitive and tedious No freeplay planned for future updateNo truely dynamic storyScripted calls and story eventsThe game just released and is the studios first game, so I have faith it will improve.810 would buy I honestly dont know if I should really recommend this game. I really enjoyed the beginning. The idea and art are really good. But the length of the game is just unreasonable. The mid-end game is way too much of the same thing but you just keep on because you want to know the end. When interesting things happen one way or the other it always feels like your choice didnt matter that much or more like you have no way of knowing what is the best choice. And when you finally reach the end there no satisfaction but more of a feeling of emptiness and absence of control. I think the game is supposed to be a metaphor for moby dick and futile pursuits but i think its pushing the experience a bit too far. The game is actually really good for the price it has a rich story and gameplay down to the details, although it does have some minor issues I would recommend this game to anyone who loves story rich games for cheap. Ill tell you a story to show you one situation in the game.Be me starting off learning the gameHire my first cops and detectives and think everything is going to go goodI want to have a positive relationship with city hall but lots of things get in the wayA old friend comes up and says I need to help him with the mafia so he can escape townSo I help him and end up joining the mafiaCity Hall has been cutting my budget forcing me to fire detectives and officersSalary is 395 a week at this point with only 10 cops and 3 detectivesMafia says they will fund 5 officers and 3 detectives and pay me if I avoid a crime every now and thenI avoid maybe one crime every 3 days for the mafia and they pay me and fund most of my officers salarymfw the mafia is doing better at keeping the city safe then the city is by funding my police dept.",

        "text": "This game comes loaded with promise. You play Chief of Police Jack Boyd, a hard-boiled old-school cop trying to get enough money to retire and survive a city full of gangs, political corruption, and apathetic citizens. Its very atmospheric, and I was drawn in almost immediately. The voice acting for Jack really helps set the scene, and there are lots of little touches that make the games world feel real.At first. MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOWYou see, this game gives you 180 days to get Jack to his goal of 500,000. I had met this goal by day 80, and even with some story-related time skips, the game drags and the story gets sparser and sparser until I felt like the developers hadnt had any idea how to wrap things up. Main plot threads are tied up in increasingly contrived manners and the game railroads the player in its final act into a forced binary choice about which corrupt, sleazy individual to support for head of the city. Sure, it lends to the games dark atmosphere, but by this point the player feels no sense of agency. I was playing like a hustler and a supercop- City Hall loved me, my staff adored me, I made tons of money off the mob only to betray them and break up their operation to the tune of almost half my monetary goal- and then the game says No, you suck again. Which one of these two characters who cannot succeed without you would you like to have win rather than you? I badly, desperately wanted an option to tell them both that I didnt care and wouldnt help either, which would have perfectly fit Jacks character. Heck, even an option to run for mayor myself would have varied things up, maybe given me a chance to call in all the friends and connections I had built in gameplay... but nope, pick your flat Pepsi or sour Coke and watch a final disappointing cutscene.Im fine with stories where the protagonist doesnt win, but this is diabolus ex machina of the worst kind. Everything in gameplay was going my way, but the story went its own way and decided that heads I won, tails I lost. If this struggle had been reflected in gameplay and tied in with the overall narrative better, fine. As-is, I got a little bit of foreshadowing and then had the game metaphorically beat me up and take my lunch money.The ending of a game is important. And this one has a complete lack of respect for the player, its world, and the game as a whole. While I had fun in the first half of the game, the latter half of the campaign is a slog and the story unravels and careens in wild directions. Not worth your money. There is a lot to like about This Is The Police. Some solid art. Some great music I love how you can purchase your own records in-game via a music catalogue. And the concept itself is really good. A police chief on the take who has to make daily management choices with narrative implications? The comparisons with Papers Please are obvious enough. And to the extent that it is similar to that game, it works. Unfortunately it falls down in a crucial respect - player choice. Papers Please does not rail-road you into certain decisions. It gives you some requirements feeding your family!, and sets up the pressure that encourages you to make some choices rather than others. However in the end you are shaping the experience. You are chosing who to let through, and who not too. Monetary pressures may influence your choice, but it is still your choice. In This Is the Police, however, you have no choice. Early on the game presents you with the choice of working for the mob or not. Aha! So I thought what I had here was the option of being full-on corrupt OK, some people might like this, or just a guy who is gaming the system, but had some kind of 80-20 gray morality you do what you gotta do to get by, some nudging and wiking within limits, but fundamentally, i.e. 80 of the time, you believe in some semblance of law and order. However if you choose not to work with the mob, you are forced to anyway. Making your choice meaningless, and raising the question - why even give you one at all?As you play your mob overlords will give you commands. You can refuse to do a specific job, but refuse more than a few and your game is over you get arrested by the feds, or what have you. You are, in other words, - forced - to be at the beck and call of the mob. You are a puppet. Basically. Do what we tell you. Or else game over, buddy. You do at some point get to choose if you work for the old mob, or the new guy in crime, but that is as far as it goes.This is when the game lost me. Playing an old police chief who is trying to build up a little retirement fund? Great idea. But the developers needed to place the emphasis on letting the player enjoy that simple experience. Narrative should help as an elaboration, but the purity of the experience what Papers Please really is about, should be the driving force. Otherwise you are taking a back-seat to your own game, in a sense, and may as well be watching a movie.If it comes up on sale, you might want to grab it. Because this game does do a lot of cool things. Its just that as a -game- it doesnt really respect the player.

The game lasts far too long with no incentive to go forward apart from the scattered story elements. If the game lasted for half as long it would have been an absolute reccomend.PROS- An interesting story with unique and interesting characters- An amazing concept with inital amazing mechanics- Each crime and theres well over 500 has unique text that is almost always worth reading- The detective cases add a nice distraction from the gameplay- A great art style- Simple and easy to grasp gameplay- Great soundtrackCONS- Story elements are few and far between- Your choices made in game have little to no impact on anything- Game ends up becoming repetitive and goes for FAR too long- After a certain point the game requires no thought and is unloseable- No way to speed up each day- Some unobtainable achievementsThis Is The Police is an....interesting game. It starts out with an amazing premise, interesting gameplay, unique characters and then just doesnt do anything beyond that.Lets get this out of the way first TitP is NOT a Visual Novel. It is not a Choose Your Own Adventure game that many people seem to think it is. TitP is a simple management sim game and thats all it is. The choices presented to you throughout the 20 hour story have little to no effect on the story. They may help you get to the end of it but they will never change the outcome. In this way its essentially nothing more than a management sim with an on-rails story.Story wise, you play as Jack Boyd, a retiring police commissioner who wants to earn 500,000 before he retires in 180 days. The game takes place over those 180 days gameplay wise its around 150 days. Youll be introduced to the corrupt Major Rogers  who holds your job by the balls, the Sands Mafia who controls the city from the underground as well as a bunch of other interesting characters as you try to survive for 180 and earn all that money.As far as gameplay goes its not overly complicated. You spend 99 of the game overlooking a map of Freeburg the city the game takes place in. Crimes will pop up around the city and its your job to send officers to solve them. Your officers have Professionalism points. Each officer will earn 10 every time they arrest the purp and officers with over 500 points are almost entirely self sufficent, being able to solve crimes on their own. There are some unique dispatches as well.  City Hall will sometimes ask you to do certain things like fire all black officers and its up to you whether you wish to do things like that. Very early on in the game you get to choose a mafia side to team up with you cant say no and theyll sometimes ask you not to send officers to crimes in return for some money.There are more options that open up as the game goes on, such as bringing back contraband to the police station or the mafia, sending officers to protests and forging evidence to pin any violence caused their on a certain faction. There also detective cases which are really quite fun. Sometimes a murder or robbery will happen and youll have to send detectives to try and work out the crime. Every day a detective is assigned to it theres a chance youll obtain photos of the scene. Once you have enough photos you can use witness accounts to piece together the crime and arrest the criminal. Its an interesting idea and stays strong throughout the entire game.So where does it go wrong? The first and id say the biggest problem is that the game is just simply way too long. Story elements are few and far between and the game overstays its welcome even before the halfway mark. 150 days is a LONG time. The early game is absolutely the most fun as youre struggling to level up your ragtag officers, teaming them up with other awful officers to try and create a strong police force all the while trying to juggle tasks between the mafia and city hall. As the game goes on, it more or less just becomes send your best dudes and a few smaller dudes to the crime. Once you get an officer past 500 points the game essentially becomes unloseable. If somehow a low point officer dies you just recruit a new one. Even the heavy crimes such as massacres and armed robberies become nothing to a high point officer leading some rookies. You can also choose to send a swat team and paddy wagon to some crimes but with enough high point officers this isnt at all needed.Apart from the game being too long, the gameplay remains stagnant. After learning what everything does and how to control your squad, the game does nothing with your experience. You will spend all your time sending officers to crimes. Mid game an interesting side quest pops up, but it can be solved fairly quickly and doesnt deviate from normal play. Choices you make have no impact on gameplay, officers dying means little, not sending officers to crimes doesnt seem to have much repercussion sometimes you simply just dont have enough officers. Essentially, as long as you dont screw over the mafia you can coast to end game with a few strong officers.Really, there isnt much else to say. The gameplay is repetitive and never changes and the game goes for far too long. It could have ended after 60 days and it would have been amazing. You unlock a sandbox mode after beating the game but by that time youll never want to touch it again. Ill say what others have said before, this game drags on for far too long. The first 20 to 30 days get you hooked, repeating it past the 70 day mark though? Its a real grind. Mess up, and city hall starts forcing you to fire cops off your payroll. This is where the game locks you in to an inevitable failure state. Failure breeds failure, and This is the police will start taking the resources necessary for you to even make it through the day. When you ask for more cops, City Hall often wont meet your request because you keep failing with the shortage of cops you have. The slippery slope mechanic here is unforgiving and doesnt leave the player with much room to make a comeback. Git Gud? sure, i can accept that, but for a first time player whose already getting bored less than halfway through, what incentive is there to go back and restart your save? Honestly, I was glad when i lost early. I no longer feel obligated to complete this game. I stopped playing six years ago due to the Investigations bug, but I jumped into the game again today thinking that after six years and a sequel that particular bug was finally squashed.  Sadly, it was not.  Im not sure how it has persisted, but six years is six years too long for such a game breaking bug to persist.  I hate to un-recommend the game over a game breaking bug, oh wait no I dont, thats exactly the reason why people shouldnt recommend the game.One awkward work around is to repeatedly restart the game if you dont get any frames by the end of the day, effectively erasing an entire days progress, and then having to repeat it all over again. Presented as a simplified police management sim or strategy game, This Is The Police is simply not what it presents itself to be. First, you have no choice at the beginning of the game on whether to be corrupt or not, whatever choice you make, the outcome is the same and you are forced into corruption.Managing your officers and answering calls is impossible without a strategy guide, a bizarre catch all stat called professionalism dictates how effective your officers are, but it is applied entirely arbitrarily - with hidden hard limits set by the game on whether you will succeed on calls for example, 2 officers with 800 professionalism anything less than this limit is a failure. Once youve met the arbitrary professionalism limit for a task, almost every choice every call, every investigation becomes a simple A, B, C, D question with success dictated by choosing the correct answer with very few clues as to what these could be. Most of your efforts will go towards trial and error in an attempt to alleviate these issues, and you will progress. Youll probably even start to enjoy it more. Then youll find some of your officers willing to offer evidence against you, hire a snitch within the force itself, and find yourself trying to guess what is going on with the betrayal just to avoid a Game Over screen. Eventually, your weaker officers will get competent from accompanying calls with more experienced officers and youll weed out disloyalty. But halfway through the game youll be hit with an event that renders almost your progress worthless. Youll suddenly find half of your officers have quit, the rest are already exhausted, and refuse to go out alone.Its all these arbitrary limits and hidden stats that make This Is The Police frustrating to play. Its presented as a management sim or strategy game with a story, when the reality is this story is the game. Its an interactive novel masquerading as a strategy game. Its entire depth is in hidden hard limits and trying to find the correct answer to calls. I could forgive using the game as a simple framing device if the story itself was good enough. Unfortunately, it is a cliche driven attempt to pastiche noir almost entirely told through poorly voiced monologue with few characters of note.I bought this game expecting a game where choice mattered, where a strategy could pay off. Instead, I received a novel where my choices, if chosen correctly, only existed to unlock cutscenes and if chosen incorrectly led to a game over screen. Too much RNG to make it enjoyable. You train your officers for weeks and then one day your team of professionals with SWAT support gets wiped by a single drunk stripper. You come to work another day and you find out that one of the officers is drunk, two others got a food poisoning for 5 days and 3 more are required for the whole day to sing on the mayors wife birthday party. If you dont send them there mayor gets angry, but if you do then you dont have enough people left on duty to respond to crimes and guess what - mayor gets angry anyway.It couldve been a great game but when your hours of effort can be negated in a second by some random event over which you have absolutely no control it stops being fun pretty quick. So no, even with the 50 discout its not worth it in my opinion. Its unfortunate that Steam asks for a yesno recommendation rating instead of, say, a five star system.Because I honest assessment is that this is three out of five stars.  Theres a lot of good stuff here.  The writing is top notch, the acting is always acceptable and in the case of the lead character, flawless, and the core mechanics of the game are actually very strong.But despite seemingly being offered a dozen choices every day for approximately 180 days, you actually have very little input in the overall game.  In fact...despite being presented with a series of A or B choices that should seemingly set the plot in opposing directions, it ALL leads up to only one ending assuming you dont die along the way.  Steam says I spent 150 hours on this game...Im sure thats an over-estimation as I may have had the game paused in the background as I did other things or slept.  But I would say that I probably put about 50 hours into it...and at the end, I feel like I watched a 50 hour long movie.  A GOOD movie...but, at the end, still a movie instead of an interactive experience.  Half the time, I was yelling into my computer screen WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS??? the same way youd yell at the idiot who wanders into the dark basement in a horror movie.  Except Im supposed to BE the character Im yelling at.Overall, this was a really strong game at times....but the single ending makes me feel that this was time wasted. I liked a lot of what This Is The Police does, but its really hindered by some quite upsetting aspects that end up completely breaking immersion, making it boring and sometimes frustrating.In short, its a game where you play the police chief in the fictional city of Freeburg in 1985, and your job is to hire officers and detective, assign them to cases, and try to navigate the politics of being a police chief in a corrupt city. Its a cool idea and it really gripped me in the beginning.But the first problematic point, for me, was - the game forces you to be corrupt. Its doesnt make it really hard to play without going bad, like for example Papers Please does. It literally forces you.Very early in the game, I got an offer from the Mafia to basically start working for them. I declined. Two days later, I was informed - they didnt accept my negative answer, Im working for them anyway. Started getting requests from them, and I just ignored those because - again - I didnt wanna be corrupt. A few more days later, the story informed me in a cutscene that I have been assassinated. The end.Well, sh!t, why even pretend to give me a choice in this if it just means I die?Fine, whatever. I restarted. My playthrough wasnt going that well anyway - I was being too nice and it resulted in officers and civilians being killed. Turns out, the best approach in every case is to be aggressive as hell. Got a hostage situation? Dont negotiate, thatll let him escape and get your officers killed. Just send SWAT in and shoot him in the head. It seems the best approach 100 of the time is to go for the kill, and once I realized that, my 2nd playthrough literally had a success rate of 100.Things were going great this time. I accepted that the game wants me to be corrupt, and I just fully embraced it this time. Did everything the mob asked. Perfectly handled every call that wasnt mob related, solved every detective case, the mayor was happy with me and so all my requests for upgrades were accepted. Everything was going great.I reached day 30 almost bored, because everything was going so smoothly I didnt even need to think anymore. I started watching youtube videos on my 2nd monitor while playing, because the game alone just wasnt interesting enough, but I did want to continue the story. Then day 31 came, and theres a time jump. Not gonna spoil why, but the story jumps forward a couple of weeks. And when I got back... things were suddenly really bad. All of my officers were exhausted, overworked and unhappy. Some had 0 energy bars left. I had to have SOMEONE in the shift so I ordered some to stay and work, but that wasnt enough to deal with all the crimes that popped up, and suddenly I had to fail handling some calls, civilians die, the mayor was mad, and... worst of all, my best detective died in a car accident, fell asleep at the wheel because he was overworked.What the fck. I get that the game needed to up the difficulty a bit because things were going too smoothly to be interesting, but taking me out only to fck up my squad and then bring me back to pick up the pieces? Thats such a lousy way to do it. Thats like saying well if you dont make mistakes, we will make mistakes for you. Why do I even bother then?Whatever. I was upset but the story was interesting enough I kept playing, and soon enough I had things under control again, and thats when things started getting interesting. I had a serial killer on the loose, which presented new challenges, plus I got a real opportunity to take out the mafia. A way out of corruption, I figured.So I start working on both of these things, mainly focused on the mafia thing. Working up the ladder, arresting people and turning them against their superior, climbing and climbing on a mountain of evidence to reach the top.Then, like 30 days later, I finally get the evidence I need to reach to top guy, and... oh, cant arrest him now. We got the final piece of evidence kinda late in the day and the lead detective on the case needs to go home. His shift ended, you see. And you cant make the arrest without him well, you can, but you risk a significantly lower chance of success. Again, what kind of bullsht is this? This is the biggest bust of his career. This is taking down the mafia. This would make him a city hero, its an arrest any detective dreams of, and... hes fine with putting it off until the day after tomorrow, because his shift just ended? What??I was just so confused by this, that I actually forgot I have the option to order him to work tomorrow, meaning Id only have to wait 1 night and not 2. So I waited another 2 days, and... by the morning of the 2nd - I get informed I was too late to the arrest, the suspect got away.Weeks of work, all down the drain because my lead detective couldnt work a bit of overtime to get the biggest bust of his life.Add to that the annoyance during these couple of weeks where we literally have a serial killer on the loose, I need all hands on deck, and every day I got a few officers coming in saying sh!t like Hey I was reading a book last night and I really wanna finish it, can I get the day off? - No, of course you cant, theres a SERIAL KILLER terrorising the city. What is wrong with you?  It was just too much. I get it, the story wants to hammer in the idea that everybody is corrupt in this city, the good guys dont always win, etc etc. Fine. But it feels like it uses dirty tricks to make these points, and with the game being this long I got to day 80-something in 8 hours, and the game is supposed to be 180 days long, so I assume it would have taken around 18-20 hours to finish, and its just too much. I cant take 10 more hours of this. If the entire playthrough was 8 hours long, that would have been fine. It was mostly enjoyable for that long. But realizing Im not even halfway through and I have to endure so much more of this was... too much. I cant do it. This Review is going to be quite long, so here is a quick summary of it all This is a game with great potential and an interesting story that lacks balance and the ability to tie it all up. The payoff is not worth the effort, there is quite literally no satisfaction at the end, So do not buy the game.Now lets get into specifics now that youve read my overall. Spoiler-Free ReviewThis game had me all over the place. The game takes about 25 hours to complete Few afk hours for me, and I must say that it was not worth it. The first 18-20 hours are incredible. I loved the game, the management system, although repetetive, was still enjoyable, and the story had me interested and I couldnt stop playing. That being said, the last 5 or so hours are absolutely unbearable. It seems as if the devs had no clue how to balance out the game. I must admit, getting the 500,000, which is the games main objective, is ridiculously easy. At the end I had something like One million 50 thousand, and could have made much more. The final thing I would like to say in my spoiler free version is that the ending was horrible, straight up. So many of the things that had me interested during the first 20 hours were all just thrown away with cop outs that did no justice to the game.That wraps up my spoiler free version. Im sure this will get downvoted by people who havent completed the game, seeing as only 4 of people have at the time of writing this. But dont let those positive reviews with 10 hours fool you.Spoiler Review Now Im going to go more in depth with the story and focus more on that.I decided to put this in the spoiler section because I feel like this would really change how people play the game, that being said, lets move on. One big flaw with this game is the illusion of choice. It plays out like its a whole good cop, bad cop kind of ordeal, but in reality it really isnt. If you dont go with the mafia, then you are dead before day 10, simple as that. This really sucks for those who wanted to choose the good cop narrative. It almost feels like Firewatch in a sense, because the ending of the game was basically decided from the start, even though there are 3 Or 4? huge decisions in the game that dont effect the ending in the slightest.Story Issues Just gonna tell you how things end up.Laura Literally nothing happens with her, after acting like she is some big conflict for Jack, she just calls and basically says shes not coming back, and thats that.Lana It seemed as if Lana was going to become a love interest of some sort, but after she finds out you worked with the mafia to get 500k, she says she is going to have you arrested. After the final assault I chose to side with Chaffee, Chaffee basically says that he killed her. Nothing else, just that, all of that story build up out of the window.Other Another thing I would like to point out is that your deputy Martin Stett said he found a lawyer who could help you keep your job after the 180 days, this just doesnt happen. After your coma, you see nothing of Martin and I had no clue what happened to him, but on the last day it says that they found his mutilated dead body in the Sewer. It seems as if the devs only way of ending a story is by the person dying, which I find to be a cop out No pun intended.That ends my rant, if you made it through this wall of text, I applaud you. This game has no satisfaction to it and is definitely not worth the 20 hours you have to put into it to complete it.Edit Spoiler Ahead Apparently the car accidents are because of the fuel transaction made late in the game Before the second coma I believe. I deleted all of these points and replaced them with another one of my main issues. However, that doesnt change my opinion on the game seeing as the ending was my real issue with the game, and unfortunately the ending didnt change. PROS-Conceptually, the idea behind this game is interesting enough.-Fun having a variety of cops to choose from.-Addictive at first.CONS-Almost whatever one does matters for nothing in the end. No real consequences to actions.-Its not really a pick your own story. -Theres no real strategy to speak of.-I stopped sending police out to missions and was never reprimanded. -Just keep the mob bosses happy and youre pretty much coasting. Hows that for substance?-The game is long and repetitive, and I completed the 180 days 19 hours hoping it would improve, but it never did. CONCLUSIONIf the point of this game is to promote cynicism about police work, then I suppose its clever in the way an annoying pun is clever. The game feels incomplete and clichd. People are liking and disliking this game for the same reason It offers only the illusion of choice. You will either be a terrible excuse for a police officer who freely lets innocents get murdered and crooks get away just to put money in your pocket, or you will be dead. Those are your options. There is just no option to be the good guy.While I do appreciate what the developers were getting at i.e. making the best of a terrible situation, I dont take well to games that force you to play in a way you dont want to. If this game was exactly the same, but the storyline allowed you to just be a good cop and take care of people, I would love it and seriously, the market is sorely needing a cop game where you are actually a good person. I would also enjoy it if there was a way to do a few small favors for the mob while secretly probing their weaknesses and finally taking them down. But I just dont identify with a character who wants to be the bad guy. Good concept. Really bad execution.The writing is awful. One obvious example an early crisis involves racist gangs targeting black people and you are tasked to fire all black officers as a result of their threats and public support for them. If you refuse, this is simply counted as failing the objective. This is absurd. Actual public relations and politics involved in running a police department are a fascinating and nuanced subject, but this game goes full retard in implementation. There are numerous other examples equally unsubtle as this. Also, the character is the chief of police but he regularly goes to a strip club and gets hammered while in uniform. I dont mind exploring the dark side of law enforcement, but the game is cartoonishly ridiculous in its depiction while having a pretentiously serious tone.Another frustrating feature of this game is that you are forced to play as a corrupt cop and it is literally impossible to play it straight you get a game over immediatley if you attempt this. This is just as stupid as the political dynamic of the game you should be able to weigh integrity vs expediency, but instead the game presents the illusion of choice and you have to play dirty.The last major criticism I have of this game is that you allocate resources based on descriptions of crimes and sometimes the outcomes are nonsensical and absurdly trivial descriptions can result in the deaths of several officers and civilians with no explanation of why this happened whatosever. This majorly undermines the strategic element of the resource management.EDIT - There is another particularly infuriating major flaw in this game I had not yet encountered at the time of initially writing this review certain events require you to act within a specific timeframe or while specific officers are on shift, but the story skips certain days and by extension shifts without warning. This is a baffling oversight as it completely derails strategies and makes it impossible for the player to plan things out.EDIT 2 - It also is extremely repetitive and drags on and on to advance in the story and unlock new features...I kept thinking I am not enjoying myself but there are obviously more features that I have not progressed enough to unlock yet so Ill stick it out only to realize I had spent a few hours going through a few weeks in game without advancing at all. Length is not necessarily a good thing with extremely dull and repetitive gameplay, but it is frustratingly padded out for no other reason than to prevent criticism about the game being too short. Alright, let me explain. I put 37 hours into this game only to find out THERE IS NO POSITIVE ENDING. I understand that in real life there arent always positive endings, which I understand. And to be frank, sometimes I like a game that has an unexpected ending. But I spent 37 hours perfecting my game. I had an excellent relationship with city hall and an excellent relationship with the mafia up until I locked him up. I ended the game with over 770,000 and still, I get a beyond depressing ending.I initially loved the game up until around day 100, when I realized it is the same thing over and over. Send cops out on 911 calls all day. Thats it. Your choices REALLY DONT MATTER. You end up in an awful situation regardless. You just chose who puts you there.There are no characters that you connect with, either. Everyone is cynical. I would not recommend this game. Feels like a waste of my time. This is definitely one of those games I would give a 35 or a 610.On the positive side of things, I liked gameplay ideas of managing a police station and putting clues together to solve the investigations.  The characters and story were also fun in a hard-boiled crime.  The soundtrack for this game is simply amazing.On the negative side of things, this is a game that presents decisions as being very impactful but the game follows a very linear narrative path regardless of what the player decides.  Once this illusion of player choice becomes clear, the gameplay around police assignments and investigations seems less important and becomes tedious.TLDR  Good premise. Great soundtrack. Lack of meaningful player impact on game outcomes unsatisfying. First playthrough, and I thought it was a relatively nice game with managing the police force and all that. However, I cant look past some of the problems this particular game has. I felt like it was kind of a bait-and-switch when it seemed like it would allow you to be either a by-the-books, honest cop or a dirty, rotten scoundrel. After playing it, the real title of this game ought to be Corrupt Cop Simulator because of two glaring problems1 If you dont work with the mob, you get assassinated pretty quickly, thus ending the game. This is a poor choice to implement in the game, especially when there are many players like me who want to serve the city.2 If you dont work with the mayor, your force continually gets cut to where you cant effectively do your job and you lose face with the public by political subterfuge. While I get that the mayor is on a real mad power trip, setting up a population thats indifferent to crime isnt terribly realistic if so, as the game explicitly described, why do people phone in crimes at all in the game?. An example of this is New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio has made an enemy of the police force by siding against the boys in blue, yet he loses favor from both the police and the public by doing so.The fact that one is seemingly given free reign to run a police force and then restricted to making decisions based on level of corruption while at the same time punishing honest play, really breaks the game. I did like playing it, but the heavy moral restriction is too much for me to recommend the game. This is the Corrupt Police, after all. Looks like an interesting resource management game, it actually thinly-veiled propoganda masquerading as a noir story, which itself is masquerading as a game. Nothing you do matters, yet you can constantly lose by doing the most ordinary things. Thats fine, Papers Please did that, and it was pretty good. Note that in Papers Please, you only go back one day, and the gameplay is very very simple. Here, your win conditions for events are so arbitrary that doing anything is a failure, theres incredibly long and drawn out badly-narrated cutscenes that you can skip but if you do, then theres no point to the game, and then when you inevitably go back to try again you end up more frustrated because literally everything that the game tells you is a choice, is actually just pre-scripted nonsense.You can tell there was an attempt to be realistic, and to provide some sort of political andor social commentary, but it just completely fails to actually say anything other than what might as well be Nothing matters, kill yourself. Im not even trying to be edgy here, this game takes the RNG from Tharsis and combines it with the cyncism of Papers Please, and then vacuum seals out all of the fun, choice, or reward. Id actually recommend you try just a single hour of this game to experience how insanely depressing it is, but also to experience the apex of horrendous voice acting. Immediately refund, of course, unless youre a masochist, in which case Im glad youve finally found the perfect game.I couldnt make it through the first month of the game, I might find myself going back since I have nothing to lose having spent three and a half hours on it already. To be fair to the game, it has decent graphics though I hate minimalist art styles and sound, and I can appreciate what they were trying to do to with the gameplay and story, but it just isnt compelling enough to sell the concept. Theres absolutely nothing to lighten up the mood, so you get so burnt out on all the cartoonishly dark rubbish going on that you end up feeling like you shouldnt even care, and thats why I stopped playing. Didnt find the day to day gameplay very engaging by day 60 was quite bored and many of the mechanics just didnt work at all tried to have the mafia murder some cops before they could testify against me, and the story skips a shift so I cant send them to the trap had three cops killed but it wouldnt let me keep the bodies in the morgue to complete a mission even though it did every other time people died vague missions like fire all old people are impossible to complete often required jobs pop up that you cant put off even 10 seconds to wait for the necessary people to get back to the station which is just frustrating and a bunch of the management options either dont make sense or dont do anything useful. This is the Police provides unique and interesting gameplay but more often than not the player takes the role of a civilian on ride along rather than the Chief of Police in a facsimile of Gotham or Chicago where everyone is corrupt as heck.The Good-Unique style of gameplay.-The visuals are low quality by stylistic and they grow on you.-The music is nice if somewhat repetitive.The Bad-The illusion of control is shattered pretty early on.-While the gamplay is unique it is ultimately pretty shallow...all you really do is try to ration your officers with the highest stars and cross your fingers that they dont get killed randomly.-The story drags on and if you are not into Noir then I have bad news for you.-Seemingly random regulations from City Hall are frustrating as heck which to be fair is probably one of the few realistic things about this game.The Ugly-Chief Jack Boyd as a character is unlikable but the good news is that 90 of the time you do not play as Jack Boyd but as a spectator of Jack Boyd. The control that you have over his actions is very limited and many times his actions are erratic and dont make sense outside of the writers mind.To be fair I may have misunderstood what this game was going into it. What I signed up for was a sort of police chief simulator where you have to send your officers to catch crooks while trying to navigate both the mob and city hall. What I got was a stylistic and uninteresting Noir story about Jack Boyd walking the line of corruption before finally crossing that line because regardless of what the player wants there is a plot and Jack Boyd is going to follow it.I will say that the sequel does improve on the over all gameplay at least. This game looked like it had a lot of potential. Interesting art style, good writing, lots of story potential, strategy, micro-management, resource allocation... And it felt like it can really mess with your mind, having to balance some seriously dodgy moral choices.And then the game happened. At some point the bubble shattered. You dont need to do good. Just keep repeating the same thing. It doesnt really matter. You do the same thing over and over and over and over again. The story arc progresses no matter how well you do. At some point sending the cars around just gets old and you start wishing you could skip the gamplay, get the next 10 minute cutscene and get it over with.The game introduces a lot of mechanics, but none are implemented very well. Its kind of shallow and not made to work together very well. The game throws things in just because it can, not because theyll add in a meaningful way. Bad poker minigame? Sure. Bad tetris minigame? Hell yes!And if you manage to do catastrophically wrong, just reload the save and pick the other choice.",
        "summary": "This game comes loaded with promise. You play Chief of Police Jack Boyd, a hard-boiled old-school cop trying to get enough money to retire and survive a city full of gangs, political corruption, and apathetic citizens. Its very atmospheric, and I was drawn in almost immediately. The voice acting for Jack really helps set the scene, and there are lots of little touches that make the games world feel real."

        "text": "710 SKYHILL is a unique zombie survival Roguelike game. Fast-paced and highly random, this independent game that pays homage to NS-Shaft to a large extent in terms of gameplay has both its attractions and major drawbacks.The gameplay is simple and easy to understand, but it also requires some figuring out to fully grasp the games mechanics. The depressing atmosphere, and the unexpectedly rich and reversing plot, as a low-cost indie game, SKYHILL certainly has some advantages to attract players to play.However, SKYHILL also has a lot of problems. The games tutorial is very short and fails to fully explain the game mechanics, which makes the player need no guide, often taking a long time to slowly understand the correct way to play the game. The random nature of the item search and the games need for luck over strategy, especially the attack accuracy problem that has been criticized by players, makes the experience for most players likely to be very bad, and as players get deeper into the game, they will find that the gameplay becomes more and more repetitive and often loses its fun quickly. The game bugs that occur from time to time also damage the players gaming experience.Players who love zombie survival games and Roguelike games can try this game - after all, its price is not very high. But the game itself is not able to retain the charm of the players in the long term, should consider whether they can accept those drawbacks before trying. On one hand, my love for this game was almost preordained, as it brought together elements of so many different game and thematic genres that I love--RPG, Roguelike, post-apocalyptic, horror, adventure and even a remarkably admirable dash of Elevator Action. But on the other, though the game is fairly light overall in virtually all of these categories, that also means it never overstays its welcome--if casual were not an insult, it would be appropriate to call this game casual, because you can play it for five minutes and truly get something enjoyable out of it. This is not something you can say for most post-apocalyptic RPGs, right? Extremely simple, sometimes oversimplified - especially when it comes to combat, but yet delivering enough joy to deserve a fair thumb up.Before you decide to buy SKYHILL here on Steam, its worth checking demo of it, to see if gameplay suits what youre looking for, and maybe... just maybe, considering getting it for your phone instead.This game was clearly designed for mobile devices in first place, and then simply ported to PC. That mean you can play it using only your mouse, or you can even challenge yourself and play SKYHILL exclusively with your left feet, but feel warned - theres no Steam achievement for that. No, dont do that, it was a bad joke.RNG is a huge part of many games, to the point where without it they wouldnt exist in the form we love them for, because rolling dices makes them more unpredictable and less monotonous.SKYHILL is all about calculating risks and possible profits then making choices based on what you see on your screen, and sometimes youll feel lucky and rewarded or unlucky and unfairly punished. Its getting heavier on hardest difficulty level, and for example I had situation, where I missed enemy 7 times in a row, and each strike had 80 chance for success, or another one where I was unable to find a single brick, which I needed to finish important upgrade. Its very important to mention, that most of time I felt like I had control over resources managment and was ready for anything I can find in next room. During my 30 approaches in most of cases I was dying because of my own mistakes and bad decisions.Amount of RNG can be increased by various perks passive and active which player can unlock pretty fast, and they add enough variety to actual gameplay, to make SKYHILL a good and interesting experience everytime you try some new combination. Great example is passive perk called absolute mess which makes you find more items in every room, but you lose one random item every 10 turns. It was fun finding how each perk affect gameplay and change the way you play in order to succeed. There are also perks without proper description, but theyre supposed to be like that, so player has to find out what they do on his own. Lore is nothing special, but also not bland, and pieces of historical background of game events unlock randomly during gameplay. It was interesting enough to make me want to play again, just to find more puzzles of it. It has everything you can expect to find in short indie game, and that include multiple hidden endings.SKYHILL is not a game for everyone. If what you want is rich RPG orwith deep combat mechanics, then none of them can be found here. But if youre looking for simple game with interesting story, where everything you need is your own brain and some luck, then theres high chance that youll enjoy your time spend in this game, just like I did. If my review helped you, then you may consider following my newly created Curator Page, I appreciate this way of supporting my work. A solid 7 out of 10, this game is just point n survive kind of game. I completed this game in like 5 hrs and all i used was my LMB and not a single key from my keyboard. It was supposed to be a fun and chill speed-run of achievements but what i got was a nightmare kind of difficulty in NORMAL mode,, mind u in normal mode... which i never expected but I didnt back down and completed the game in normal mode only. Also this game has a luck factor.. like u open rooms and u dont find any salvage or you open a room and find a spider bitch who is damn hard to defeat and you can miss your attacks, and managing your supplies and health is very crucial aspects of the game.. One can play this game in easy mode and get all achievements if they are into completionist sort of kink. The game, as it stands, is very simplistic. You go down, you check to your left, you check to your right.Sometimes theres a monster, sometimes theres not. You might get lucky.However, after about 2 or 3 times down, it gets to be pretty boring after that, and has about no replayablity,as you do exactly the same thing over and over again. Dont get me wrong, the game is well polished with very few bugs and a decent storyline through thepages and voice logs, but all in all, its not worth the 14.99 Price tag they have on it. Concidering that I have beat it well within one hour of playtime.The game is good, but the price is not. Now if it were a 4.99, it would be totally fine. Very good game, interesting mechanics. I didnt find it repetitive as it says in some reviews, its a short rogue-like but full of action. You have to go down 100 flors to find the exit, there are 3 endings and lots of really atmospheric audios and texts to pick-up, and these are the only thing that stay with you for the next playthroughs. you also unlock perks, but these are not very powerfull and usually have a downside, but some of them greatly modify the gameplay experience, so its fun. The combat system is simple but very entertaining, you atack with one of the two weapons you can have equipped and can chose where to hit, with different dmg and dificulty. The progression system is genious in its simplicity. You have 4 atributes, strength, speed, dexterity and accuracy. the first 3 affect the damage of weapons that have it as its prereq and also critical chance, extra turn chance, and dodge chance, repectively. You can find weapon or craft them, i havent tried crafting a weapon yet but theres a lot to craft, food, medicine, general stuff and weapons, there is no armour in the game though. Food is needed for movement, just another layer in the strategy but really immersive, there are dozens of different foods and recipes to mix up foods. I like the perk that lets you eat rotten food withot any danger. And the story is really atmospheric and creepy.  Great game Its simple.You are on the highest floor of an expensive hotel when the world turns upside down. To have some chance for survival you have to get out. All it requires is to go through 100 floors.Now the hard side.Each step costs you 1 hunger point, so you better search other hotel rooms for some food or things that can be turned into food. Beware the ripped ones or you want to get sick? You have nothing else to eat? Hard choice then, eat it and risk losing some health points or slowly starve to death no food means -1 point of health each step.What about those monsters in the rooms? Well, you can run away from them if they let you. What about the monsters blocking your way on the stairs? Hm, is the elevator functioning? If you are lucky, you can go around them, if you are unlucky, you have to fight them. Again, it would be wise to search the rooms for any items that can be used as weapons or turned into weapons in your president suite. Dont get fooled by those weak monsters at the beginning, bring some serious stuff with you to the lower floors.You got hurt in the fight? Quickly, use medkit, pills, bandages anything! You have nothing? Oh my go into your room to sleep then. And pray that your doors are secure enough to protect you from uninvited visitors they can eat your food, steal your best weapon, destroy random items, cause that you lose more health than you gain.You are still alive?Just 10 floors to the main entrance?Wanna tell me of the horrors you have seen? No.. okay, I understand. Some serious stuff going on here. Okay then, good luck.Just just be careful that the RNG God doesnt kick you right between your eyes.Oh well, who am I fooling around. It will happen. More than once.Be prepared. Great game. I have really enjoyed it, although it can be pretty frustrating, especially when you are going for the hardcore run. But I have never rage quitted and still pushed for more. There are a lot of things that you can uncover. I am still not sure what is the truth here. Also the modes and perks you open offer great replayability and fun! Rating 7.210 OverviewSKYHILL is a survival roguelike game developed by Mandragora and released in 2015. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, it follows the story of a man named Perry, who is trapped in a luxurious hotel after a global biological attack. Players must survive on the top floor of the hotel while navigating through different floors filled with mutated enemies and limited resources. The game features strategic resource management, crafting, and turn-based combat. The goal is to descend through the hotel, gather supplies, and escape. Pros Atmosphere  The dark, grim setting of the game adds to its immersive, survival horror feel. The combination of pixel art with post-apocalyptic design creates a compelling visual narrative. Strategic Depth  Players must manage health, food, and supplies carefully while making tough decisions that can impact their survival. Unique Combat System  The game features a turn-based combat system that requires careful planning and use of limited resources, making every encounter feel tense and meaningful. Replayability  Due to its roguelike nature, each playthrough is different, offering a new challenge every time. The random elements and various upgrades increase replay value. Cons Slow Pacing  Some players may find the pace of the game slow, especially when exploring the hotel and managing resources, which could detract from the overall experience. Repetitive Gameplay  While the roguelike mechanics keep things fresh, the gameplay loop can feel repetitive, especially with limited combat options and progression. Limited Story Development  While there is a storyline, it is not as deeply developed as some players might hope, leaving some to feel that the plot doesnt fully engage them. Steep Difficulty  The difficulty can be overwhelming for new players, with survival relying heavily on luck and strategic planning, which may frustrate those seeking a more casual experience. Player SentimentPositive Reviews Players appreciate the survival elements and the unique atmosphere of SKYHILL, praising the strategic depth and replayability. The games setting and pixel art style are often highlighted as strengths.Negative Reviews Common criticisms revolve around the slow pacing, repetitive gameplay, and the steep learning curve, which can turn off players who prefer more action-oriented games. Target AudienceFans of survival roguelikes and turn-based strategy games.Players who enjoy post-apocalyptic settings and resource management.Those looking for a challenging and atmospheric game with a dark narrative. Rating Breakdown Gameplay 7.510 Graphics  Art Style 710 Replayability 810 Mechanics  Balance 710 Community  Support 6.510Overall Experience 7.210 Final VerdictSKYHILL offers a unique and challenging survival experience set in a post-apocalyptic hotel. With its blend of resource management, strategic combat, and roguelike elements, it delivers a tense and rewarding survival challenge. However, the slow pacing and repetitive gameplay may hinder its appeal for players who prefer faster action or more narrative-driven experiences. Its a solid choice for fans of the genre, but may not be for everyone. Seemingly a mystery about apocalypse or a mad mans rampage down a skyscraper.The first playthrough may be exciting but gradually,alittle disappointed, much into the game.Truthfully rather lacking in content.RePlayability are few story plots but is purely to grind off collection of the journals or to get redundantly get yourself killed 100 times for achievements.Just a Click Fest, three points of entry on every level, RNG melee fights,luck and random based collection of loots with majority which are empty...Playable but cant see it worthy at full price, glad the game was on 90 discount. Now dont get me wrong...I actually do recommend this game even though its caused me a lot of pain. The RNG is very real and offerings are made regularly to those fickle gods. Ive swung at an enemy at a 90 percent hit chance and whiffed hard more times than I can remember...but i still come back for more. I must be getting masochistic in my old age but there is definitely a draw to figuring it all out regardless of the hardship this game puts you through. Dont get me started on hunger. Walking to an adjoining room reduces hunger by 1? you have 100 really? ive never walked into another room and gotten hungry. Wasnt all that taxing. I understand the need for constraints to make the game a challenge but whoa. Its a bit like it taking 45 minutes to take a pee in like sims or something level of ridiculous. This wouldnt be such a problem if enough food were generated. Ive had a completely upgraded kitchen and my guy was like Top Chef friggin Ramsey and I couldnt make something to eat out of all the rotten produce in my inventory. or lack thereof any kind of food really So the drop rates gonna piss you off, the hit chance is gonna make you wanna rage quit, the inability to craft that weapon you want cuz your stats suck is gonna sap your soul...but you will want to play more. And thats why I recommend this one. Have fun! . Reasonable game that you can play with Mouse Only. However, the game play is a bit lacking in my opinion. Nothing over the top special that really stands out. Probably worth a few play throughs, for Achievement Hunters. Otherwise its sort of a wash rinse repeat. I see too many bad reviews here and i really dont see the reason.. Skyhill is a rogue-like , survival , turn-based , procedural generation , crafting game.Its artwork is simple but nice and its music too , and it really fits to the game nicely.. Its story is not great but not bad too , its an ok story.. The fighting system is extremely weak , thats true , the player should have a lot of different attacks unlockable or not and not just flat 3 hits based on  and the enemies should have different skills too which they dont.. If you buy it on sales its a good game for its price , i hope they make later the fighting system a little more interesting.. I didnt encounter any bugs yet , and its an okish game to play for some hours.. There is no reason for all that rage , you get what you paid for , stop crying people and enjoy the game! You pretty much get what the trailer shows, a survival game where you travel down a hotel, scavenging supplies, building weapons, upgrading safehouse and repeatedly dying. The game has some replayability thanks to unlocking perks which give you a special start bonus, though some of those are near useless while others superior over everything else.Combat is simplistic and turn based, only real option being deciding if its worth the risk to trade blows or retreat, it could do with more options. Its the stats, equipment and some dice rolling that decides if you win for the most part. Some fights are unavoidable too, while others can be bypassed entirely or occur in side areas.The game is randomly generated which adds to replayability but also makes obtaining the components for your desired weapon that much harder.And theres multiple endings too, if youre engaged enough to want to look for them. All in all, if the trailer interested you, go for it. incredibly underrated survival game, its really simple to just pick up and play, and its pretty damn difficult too lol Im generally a little bit dubious about the whole rogue-like phenomenon, but occasionally you encounter a game where its handled exceptionally well.  Monstrum and Darkest Dungeon both come to my mind, and now I can very safely add Skyhill.  Why am I so dubious of the rogue-like phenomenon you ask?  Because Im a firm believer that 98 of the time, what makes great art great art - whether the art form in question is music, movies, books, or, yes, even video games - is careful and meticulous DESIGN.  Because rogue-likes, by their very nature, add in highly randomised elements to determine the mapping and what-not of the game in question, the likelihood of such games being well-designed becomes greatly compromised.  Having said all that, it is my relief to announce that SKYHILL IS A STAGGERINGLY WELL-DESIGNED GAME.    I guess its maybe a bit like improvisation jazz music...occasionally, it rocks, but for the most part it emerges as little more than a sloppy, communal WANK.  But when that chaos somehow all pulls together - bear with me, trying to keep the communal wank metaphor going - then something magic can happen.  Thats precisely what the makers of Skyhill have pulled off here...MAGIC.  Its deceptively simple, but hard as a motherfucker.  Youll get it in very little time at all - the combat system is straightforward, ditto the crafting system, and anything and everything else you care to mention - but its designed in such a way that you will almost certainly die multiple times before you beat it, even on Easy difficulty.  This is partly because progressing through the one hundred floors of the building unlocks perks which you can choose between at the start of a new game, without which youre really not liable to make it all the way to the bottom.  Theres also a learning curve, such as one which led me to prioritise achieving certain things such as crafting certain weapons as soon as possible in order to improve my chances in the long-term.     I dunno...maybe to super-seasoned rogue-likeRPG-lite gamers out there this would be little more than a grind-fest, but for me personally it required the gradual accumulation of a STRATEGY to get through the fucker.  And, of course, luck also plays a role...but its always going to in this genre of gaming, lets face it.  But its still pretty darned fair on the whole, in my humble opinion.    Overall, I really cant imagine how this could have be any better designed, and its just challenging enough - but also just hey, at least Im slowly making progress enough - to be a really fun and addictive little game.  I hit it for five hours straight the first night I played it, and thats a rarity for me, to say the least.  Its also nice to have a game which is a bit of a dungeon-hack, minus the dungeon though the horror setting is only liable to be scary to your grandmother, but its still a tone and atmosphere which I personally prefer to the usual light fantasy fare.     Oh, and for all the value-for-money people, theres four difficulty levels, as well as innumerable weapon crafting options, selectable perks which significantly change gaming strategies, and a hefty shit-tonne of achievements to aim for, so even at full price no one needs complain about longevity of gameplay I mean sure, it might get a tad repetitive eventually, but all you people seem to enjoy forty to fifty hours of mindlessly shooting and looting the same stuff in Borderlands game after Borderlands game after Borderlands game, dont you?!      Definitely one of my games of the year, even if the ending is a bit on the lame side no big challenge or boss fight or anything...you just walk out the front door of the bottom floor of the building, and somehow end up in a cut-scene on the ROOF!  Luckily the game isnt really about the story, though, but rather the EXPERIENCE...and a very, very enjoyable and compelling experience Ive found it to be.  Let me put it this way  Now that Ive conquered the Easy mode, Im already itching to beat it on Normal, and no doubt the higher difficulties after that.  If thats not the definition of a well-made turn-based game, Ill be darn-fucked if I know what is.    Verdict 9.510. Skyhill is the popcorn of video games. Kinda light and bland, but with just enough crunch and flavor to be interesting. Its the light snack you need when you want to play a game, but are too tired to deal with complex mechanics, manic twitch reflexes, or overwrought story arcs. Skyhill is a roguelike post-apocalyptic horror game in which you start on the 100th floor of the Skyhill hotel and must explore your way down to the first floor. Each time you move from room to room on each floor there are three rooms the stairwell and two rooms on the left and right you lose one hunger, and there is a chance youll encounter a mutant to fight in turn based combat. You craft weapons, upgrades, medical supplies, and food from the things you scavenge from rooms. Throughout the game you discover newspaper clippings, photos, notes, and lost cell phones that give clues urging you to go to specific floors that hint at a deeper story going on in the background, which I find quite intriguing.The game has a pretty intuitive interface, and you quickly learn which enemies to fight and which to pass up. If I had any suggestions for improvements, Id say Id like to see buffs attached to prepared food or medical supplies.All told, its a fun, creepy, and atmospheric game that packs a lot of challenge but isnt cheap about it. When you screw up, its often because you overestimated your combat prowess or overextended or misuse your resources. I can see myself playing a lot of in the future. It has lots of replay value in that there appears to be a secret ending that you can uncover if youre lucky or persistent or both.910, will play again! TL DR versionI am keenly aware that Skyhill does enough right to merit a recommendation. However, I am going to give it a CAREFUL recommendation at the current stage and the current price. 15 is a tad high for what this game is. It needs some more content, methinks... For now, anything from 33 off or more would make it an easy buy, as you will absolutely get your moneys worth.Longer versionIn Skyhill, you are a businessman on a short trip who decides to rest in the best Suite of a large luxurious 100-story hotel during a time of war. During his stay, one of the warring sides and obviously the losing one, the Confederates, launches a biological weapon at your location that turns everyone into mutants or zombies. You survive, but soon the hunger drives you out and you need to find a way to survive and go to the ground using all the resources you can fnd at your disposal, or die trying in this post-apocalyptic rogue-lite game.So lets take a look at what the game does well, and what poorly.The GOOD1. Lots of rooms to explore and loot - you will have over 190 rooms to explore and loot throughout your adventure, contaning everything from food to stuff you can use as weapons or consumables, or to save for later for crafting.2. Upgradable stations - in short, your suite is your fortress. You can improve it in a number of ways. You can create better weapon building or cooking stations, fortify the door and fix up the bed so you can rest better and regain health.3. Lots of items to craft and use - the amount of weapons to make and use in combat is amazing - and it pays to note that some weapons can also be upgraded to better versions by using the core weapons. The devs really went overboard with the craftables be it weapons, food, or stuff you can make on the fly like bandages and medicine. The system really forces you to think whether you should use a certain item or save it for later. And about that...4. Decisions you make when it comes to craftables matter - being a rogue-lite with a randomly generated loot, it is always a huge decision whether to use a certain item or not, as god knows whether youll find another one of those. In the end, when all falls into place, knowing that youve made the correct decisions is extremely satisfying.5. An RPG system that ties well into the weapon crafting - you have 4 skills that can be improved throughout the adventure and govern various types of combat - strength the ability to wield powerful heavy weapons that do the most damage, speed the ability to wield fast weapons and also get faster with improved chance for 2 action per turn, dexterity the ability to wield weapons based on agility and dodge in combat and accuracy, which improves you chance to hit.6. Starting and unlockable perks that make your playthroughs vary a lot  - from the ability to always go first to being extra lucky or have an extra ration or a medkit in your backpack, picking different perks during the various playthroughs will let you experience the game from a different perspective.7. Great combat - as a consequence of 3-6, the combat in this game is really good, and the outcome of a fight always ties into every decision you have made so far, be it wrong or right. And talking about decisions, you can also manually target various parts of the enemy body to inflict more damage at a higher chance to miss or less damage with a higher chance to hit. Just remember to run away when things go bad... No need to die heroically when you can still live to fight another day.8. Mini quests to keep you occupied while exploring - from finding keys to open various rooms to discovering cell phones with messages on them, you always have someting to look for as you search the floors of the hotel.9. Good game aesthetic for a rogue-lite - while I wouldnt put that on the top of the list, I still appreciate how the game looks for a 2-D one.10. Great replayability - the combination of perks, stuff you find, character build you make, and the little quests always make for a different experience the next time you boot up the game.And now lets take a look at the BAD1. To counter 10 of the GOOD, even though a good number of parts of the game feel differently based on the perks, skills, weapons and stuff you pick, you ultimately do the same thing over and over again - find loot, craft, eat food, make weapons, open rooms, fight, survive, and hopefully get out of the hotel alive. I, personally, finished the game 3 times in my 5 hours of play, and sadly, I couldnt shake that feeling upon leaving the hotel...2. The RNGesus can make or break your game, unless you like to invest heavily in accuracy so that you wont miss too often. Or, of course, you get stuff that doesnt fit your character build at all... Or not enough food or medicine... or other stuff... you get the point.3. You can lose games through no fault of your own - in true rogue-lite fashion, victory through correct actions is not guaranteed. You may not find the stuff you need to get you set up properly, or you can get attacked way too often and die, and so on and so forth.4. I didnt exactly enjoy the music... while it undoubtedly fits the whole experience, I eventually muted it and played my own.5. Once you unlock all the perks, dying does feel like a true game over - until you unlock every perk, dying is ok and always lets you try something new the next time around. But once you unlock everything, dying is just that - death, game over, force restart.ConclusionI am keenly aware that Skyhill does enough right to merit a recommendation. However, I am going to give it a CAREFUL recommendation at the current stage and the current price. 15 is a tad high for what this game is. It needs some more content, methinks...For now, anything from 33 off or more would make it an easy buy, as you will absolutely get your moneys worth. Why?Easy. If you are a huge loot hoarder like me, like exploring, improving and seeing the stuff you do matter, this game is absolutely the right one for you. However, if you get easily irritated by loss, bad dice rolls, or games that expect you to play them for a bit to learn their quirks, I would stay away from it. Skyhill has quite an interesting concept, where you start at the 100th floor of a zombie-infested building and, with no other way out, you have to traverse all floors to finally reach the exit. It reminded me a bit of Kingdom, in the sense that the layout is randomly generated, you have a base of operations, you gather resources to craft new and better equipment and you have to pass 100 floors, like the 100 days for a satisfactory victory in Kingdom.But it gets a bit repetitive quite soon. Like it needs some spicing up.  I had some fun while playing, but the randomness with which you acquire resources can get very frustrating, especially on the harder difficulties.The multiple endings were intriguing to say the least. Was it a zombie apocalypse after all? On one hand, my love for this game was almost preordained, as it brought together elements of so many different game and thematic genres that I love--RPG, Roguelike, post-apocalyptic, horror, adventure and even a remarkably admirable dash of Elevator Action. But on the other, though the game is fairly light overall in virtually all of these categories, that also means it never overstays its welcome--if casual were not an insult, it would be appropriate to call this game casual, because you can play it for five minutes and truly get something enjoyable out of it. This is not something you can say for most post-apocalyptic RPGs, right?",
        "summary": "The gameplay is simple and easy to understand, but it also requires some figuring out to fully grasp the games mechanics. The depressing atmosphere, and the unexpectedly rich and reversing plot, as a low-cost indie game, SKYHILL certainly has some advantages to attract players to play. The games tutorial is very short and fails to fully explain the game mechanics."

        "text": "EDIT I have added further comments below.This game isnt particularly fun or difficult. To clarifyYes. Its a roguelike. You start out without any passive or active abilities, and you have to learn them as you re-live your life.I started the game in normal mode, and made it down to floor 59. Thats almost half way to the bottom on my first go-around. Thats unheard of in most roguelikes. The battle system and enemies lack any particular flair. Called shots make things interesting, but theres not really a point if theres no advantage in hitting a specific area. Yes, striking a monster in the head will cause more damage than the torso, but why not have a chance to stun or blind? The same goes for limbs why not a chance to decrease enemy strength or cause accuracy to fall? Missing the ability to equip your character with any sort of armor was confusing. It definitely made things less interesting when it came to decisions about what I would attempt to upgrade.Finding food and health objects is not necessarily difficult. The first time I decided to head back to the VIP room was because I wanted to see about crafting a weapon. I didnt even know that you could use the bed to rest and trade food for health. Strangely, sleeping off your injuries isnt really a great deal compared to just exploring a few floors to find some more health items.The crafting system is more interesting for sure. As you progress in the weapons you can make, things get even easier.The mechanic of entering a room and clicking on objects became boring and repetative. Coming upon a locked door didnt really make me frustrated, because I knew I was only missing out on the contents of a single room.Control boxes found on some floors require tampering to ensure that power goes to the floors below. I found this the most interesting aspect because it was the only challenging question I had to deal with do I want to try fixing this thing? The answer was always yes, and it felt like 50 of the time I could do it on the first shot. I never attempted to use an item to fix the panel. It seemed like a waste of time.Item drops are notably sparse aside from basics like food and health. A weapon above a basic killing implement was never dropped during my game. That is to say - I had a few weapons drop, but they were far surpassed by the things I had already created for myself.No, I did not give this a whole shake. Yes, I only played for about two hours. No, I dont want to continue playing - the game is boring, and I have better things to do with my time.Oh, a few positives - the voice acting in memoirs left behind seemed to be mildly engaging. Unfortunately, grasping the full scope of the situation was not something I really felt was necessary. Especially since your character doesnt really have a dog in the fight besides I am in the top floor of a tower. I would like to leave this tower.The crafting system is interesting. I could see it going far, but armor would be a welcome addition. Further, the ability to create almost anything required with wood, rags and scrap metal is kind of odd.Theres also some flavor text notes left on walls and corpses which seem to hint at a greater story arch.This game seems like it would be better suited on my phone, and played specifically while taking a long dump. Paying rapt attention to the goings-on are not necessary, and theres not really much of a decision-making process when it comes to playing the game. Will I explore both rooms on this floor? Yes. Will I continue down to the next floor? Yes. Rinse - repeat.If I were to recommend something to the developers, I would recommend somehow increasing the size of the floors beyond two rooms. Missing out on a room due to a lock is a non-issue. I have no idea what I missed by not entering those rooms, and even after I found keys to go back and find out later, I didnt. Finally, I am not sure if I missed it, but a map would be useful - something to see if I can get back to a locked room.ADDENDUMA note to the dev team dive deeper guys. This game was on training wheels, and I can tell that you definitely tried. I did not experience a single bug. The art work was great. The animation was smooth. The sound and set design were great. The concept was engaging, and I am a HUGE sucker for rogue-likes. This concept pushed all the right buttons.Yes, I was disappointed, but thats alright. I want bigger, better, more complicated stuff from you in the future. I want you to succeed. This was a good idea. THIS GAME WAS A GOOD IDEA! I swear to god, if you create an R-rated version of this with more complicated features, I will be back.SUPER ADDENDUMThis is addressed to BroshanMaking the game more difficult would have made it more of a challenge, but it wouldnt have changed the fact that traversing floors was more of a chore than it needed to be. A quick way to improve this specific game would be to at least speed everything up - have a keyboard command to just retrieve all items in a room. At least then you can get done with everything immediately instead of going through the chore of clicking on separate room components.Because of the floor construction, there was no complexity. There are almost no choices to be made in a direction of travel. There isnt even an inventory system - your character has pockets that can hold everything, and theres no need to leave behind some items in order to store or keep others. Again - no choice to be made just take everything you can click on. You cant save inventory items on the top floor because theres no need to. It would be  logical for a game like this given you have a safe room which you can effectively return to at almost any point.Roguelikes in particular suffer when you lack the ability to make informed decisions. It feels really good when you make the right choice, and are duly rewarded by the games mechanics. On the contrary, it feels like you are on rails when nothing you do necessarily affects how the game progresses. No one wants to feel like that when playing a roguelike.Yes, tweaking aspects of the game are necessary pertaining to item drops, but that is a drop in the bucket. The issue I am attempting to indicate is more systemic. This game needs an adult version. One with real choices, massive rewards, and crushing defeats. Skyhill could have been great, unfortunately no thought was given to its roguelike nature. Everything exists within complete RNG, to the point where the only friendly NPC will ask you to trade randomX for randomY, even if X is an end game item and Y is extremely common. Some weapons can only be crafted from other mid-grade weapons, which arent craftable at all. Ive never seen them drop. Dont know if they even exist.Once completing the game once youd be unlikely to want to play again. You only made it to the end due to good luck. No skill will change the outcome of your game. That being said, I still have a soft spot for this game, but the raw RNG is really poor. It would also be extremely easy to fix the problems with some simple feedback loops. Maybe theyll patch it eventually. After 10 minutes of gameplay I thought Hey, this game is good!, I mean, cool concept, nice arts, roguelite, I liked it! Then why I dont like it now? Because 100 minutes later I didnt find anything else.Im bored, the gameplay is this you click down, get to the lower floor, see en enemy, click to kill it, click to loot, click, click, click. Youll click more than youll think. You can craft, you can find different enemies not more than 10 different enemies to be honest but its just numbers, your better weapon will do some more damage, the stronger enemy will do some more damage.For a roguelike game this is easy, and straight forward, there are no choices, you go down, kill, loot, craft better weapon, assign your skill point in order to use that weapon and so on, youll never think I was good here! or Damn, I made a mistake well, except for silly mistakes, of course, theres not satisfaction, your failure or success is just a coin flip. And... Ill tel you this you wont even see the actual coin! I mean, you read the perchentage, click, and youll just see the damage you inflicted or the Miss.Thats it.Gotta say the contents here are well crafted, there is just... not enough content, and whats worse no depth in the gameplay. And everything is obnoxiously repetitive.The price is not high, but it still should be 33 to be fair. In that case would i suggest to buy it?No.Id still think its boring, there are a lot of better games.In the comment people told me that this is a point and click, so i shouldnt complain if you only have to click in the game. Then Ill add thisYes, this game mixes point  click and roguelite, I already said why its a bad roguelike, now three things make a Point  Click good. The narration dialog andor story. Here theres none.The environment graphics, scenarios, here is always the same.The challanges usually enigmas, anyway a Point  Click asks you to think about a solution to something, in order to be happy and satisfied when you find it.About this last one, probably the most important, as I already pointed out theres nothing to really think about in this game, no challange, no satisfaction, its easy and repetitive, so... it lacks of every aspect a point and click needs.The conclusions are that this isnt just a bad roguelite, it is even a bad point  click.Ill stick with it!You click, click, click, then click, click and click again and nothing really new or interesting will happen! The game has Great mechanics, and I do really like it, but at the same time, Your skill doesnt matter. How good you become at the game doesnt matter.Its random chance as to how far youll actually be able to progress.For example. I got the Hammer sawsword or something like that, basically a weapon that does 28-33 damage per hit supposed ot do more, but didnt have the stats for it, and I got it fairly early on in the game. For example, a starting weapon, a Kitchen Knife, does 3-5 damage per hit. Enemies have 20 health to start. And yet, even with an insanely powerful weapon to start, I still died before I passed floor 65. Because almost no food was spawning. It had nothing to do with how strong I was, or how my skills were distributed, I just had zero food, and so couldnt really recover health, since I was loosing 11 per room. And thats why Im giving this a thumbs down. Because, for me, a game where you cannot use skill to win, and instead MUST rely on luck to win, strikes me as bad game design.However, I know this isnt a negative for everyone. So if you dont mind having to rely on luck to win, by all means, go for it. For me, Im done with the game. At first sight it seems rad cool - turn-based rogue-like about survival in a hundred storey building. What can go wrong? Well.. its generally a flash-game quality visualization of a simple text-based game of luck, which quickly degrades into a slo-mo clicker of sorts with ultimately low diversity standard rooms, monsters - everything. So my basic gripe is that you cant AT LEAST click FASTER 10x. Especially when you get unlucky, and you will get unlucky regularly here.And the game readily introduces aiming at bodyparts luck mechanic, which turns this clickfest into a total nightmare of hassle  unluckiness.And then you run around the goddamn building with useless items trying to find a useful one which hadnt spawn..Stupid crafting feels just redundant, for you have to crawl back up to 100th floor to use most of recipes.Quite soon I have fallen in a trance-like state of mind  lost any interest to the fate of the character........ Skyhill is a rogue-like rpg game with a promising look but fails to deliver any depth or replay value.Pros Voiceovers are good. Premise is unique. Story is cool at parts. Rogue-lite mechanics are challenging at first run.Cons- Zero replay value, once its done its gone- Low variety of monsters- Crafting is laughable, zero depth, all luck based finds...- Zero wonder factor after first run- Looks hurried and unpolished at parts- Low variety on exploration.- Combat is abysmal410 I bought it on sale -50 and still feel ripped off. Premise is good but gameplay is pretty washed out. If you are looking for a good rogue-like experience, look elsewhere. As fun as the actual experience is, I HAVE to give this a negative review. Why?Google Skyhill Is Accuracy Bugged to see my full rant.Apparently, whoever designed this game has a poor grasp of statistics. You are the dungeon crawler who must fight through hordes of monsters. Your accuracy decreases slightly with a string of lucky successful hits, and increases with an unlucky combo of misses, in order to balance the game. Your dodge chance is directly dependent on your dexterity. Sounds fair, right? Well, monsters have a base accuracy of 100 while youre stuck with an initial 80! Your dodge chance is a pitiful 2.5 that increases only by 0.5 with each point in dexterity, at 4 points per level and an expected max level of 10 at floor 20 that only means a pitiful 22.5 dodge chance when you finally reach the elite monsters, and you need to spend points in other stats to use your strongest weapons See, there are some pure dexterity weapons but they dont gain attack power from your other stats like a multi-stat requirement weapon does! In addition, in order to progress, you must successfully hit multiple times, which usually demands you hit more times than you miss, which causes the balancing system to lower your accuracy significantly the lower you descend, while the accuracy penalty for combo hits is outright nonexistent for the increasingly difficult monsters!In short, A the monsters have a clear advantage over you in their unerring accuracy, and B statistically, you are expected to lose accuracy over time, while the monsters keep high accuracy because your dodge chance is low and will always be low even if you invest a serious number of points into dodge! They dont tell you this in the HUD or tutorials and as a result your rolls start getting increasingly unlucky, especially when you try repeatedly to use a move that is indicated to have 50-50 accuracy but is acutally like 10 from all your good rolls accuracy debuffs, until finally you crash and burn at the bottom despite all the powerful stuff you found!Excellent game ruined by horrible mathematical error, someone PLEASE remove the damn accuracy penalty! A relatively well-balanced survivalcrafting rogue-lite, where the experience is unfortunately marred by extremely careless oversights and lack of polish.The core gameplay is compelling enough and feels quite well tuned. The availability of items, the number and power of enemies, and the ticking clock as your hunger piles up keep you just on the wrong side of comfortable at the best of times, and at the worst, will have you desperately calculating your chances against an unexpected zombie just in case theres a mushy banana in that minibar beind him. As combat also rewards you with stat points that can unlock new weapons and increase your effectiveness in combat, there is always an incentive to put yourself at risk for future benefit, which helps ratchet up the pressure.The art is stylish and mostly consistent in quality, but a number of the inventory icons, particularly weapons, are not very distinctive and the background decorations are pretty simple. The animations go a long way with limited resources, however, and relieve a great deal of monotony from the turn-based combat.The crafting system is a core mechanic You wont make it through the game without stronger weapons, better recovery items, and a more effective saferoom. Crafting components can also save you time and hunger! in unlocking shortcuts back to your saferoom, but in a silly oversight you will be forced to consume items if you have them rather than be given the choice to spend your time instead. There are a robust amount of recipies that make effective use of your items, and the wide variety of weapons in particular can make for exciting upgrades.Unfortunately, you CANNOT view the effect of any potential items in the crafting menu. If you dont have the benefit of foreknowledge, you have absolutely no way of knowing what the result of spending your precious and limited resources will be, which can easily ruin a strong performance by wasting items or upgrading your only weapon into a form you dont have the correct stats to wield.Theres something to be said for the thrill of discovery, but the penalty of a crafting misstep is far too punishing in a game with such limited resources, and there simply isnt enough content in this game to justify the repeated replays it would take to learn all the items and keep your own notes.Strong initial offering crippled by an extremely frustrating design oversight in one of the core mechanics. On the balance, unfortunately cannot recommend. Yet another one of those mobile games, in which you just move from room to room by tapping on your phones screen, and search the drawers for loot The Notorious B.I.G. approves. Some games try to hide the repetitive mobile gameplay under the deep atmosphere. Some, like This War of Mine, succeed. This one? Well........ it sure tries. Theres a post-apocalyptic setting, theres some sort of the hidden story, there are some diaries to find, etc, but somehow... all that just doesnt work well enough. I mean, yeah, The Matrix has yet another Mr. Anderson and stuff, but all that feels kind of cheap and... kind of pathetic, really. And since, even though the game revolves around 100 floors, you wont do anything more than a couple of taps on each of them... lets just say thats exactly what you may expect from a cheap mobile game. Tap, tap, tap, die, tap again, repeat until youll reach the exit.Dont get me wrong, though, SKYHILL isnt that bad. Sure, it feels like a boring mess when you try to play it as a proper computer game on your huge 8K TV, but when you play it on go, in the way it was supposed to be, it feels totally fine. I kind of like playing such games while waiting for something, while cooking, or doing some other stuff, which doesnt give me enough freedom to read the book. The problem is  14.99  11.99 for something like this? Its a joke. Pretty sad one too. If youre going to buy this  buy it for your mobile device of choice. And even then, wait for at least 50 off. Dixi. This game is pretty lackluster.Respectfully, to the developers, I know they put their fair share of time and hard work into it, but it feels like someone made this in the late 90s early 2000s and let it sit on a thumb drive until the whole zombie apocalypseinfection thing had come and long passed. The setting itself is fine. I like the idea of the main character fighting their way to the first floor because somehow 80 of the elevator doors are broken in the exact same way. It has fair theming, and a lot of the rooms look pretty different. Not bad, in fact thats what mostly got me interested. Unfortunately, thats about as far as the games saving graces go.The combat reminds me of adventure quest. Its turn based, its more gambling than strategy, and there is very little that is visually appealing, not to mention I can count the different enemy type on one hand. At one point, one of the five various enemies had a gun and I was momentarily intrigued by the slight variant, only for it to never resurface.Sure, you are able to upgrade your weapons granted you find all of the very specific parts that arent gears and tape, but only some weapons are available in any of the upgraded crafting menu. I wanted to make a spear later in the game to finish a stronger recipe, but I too far along to find one of the lowest tier components, nor was I given the option to craft it. Id say if you get it at an extreme discount or as a gift, maybe play it through once or until you realize youre -going down a floor-looting-potentially fighting something-rinse and repeatThe plot turned out to be brief and poorly written. Like this unorganized mess of a review! There are just under 10 cassette tapes that you can find to reveal the main characters slow descent into madness. At least thats how it presents itself. Most of the plot is delivered through the mildly urgent ravings of your typical heterosexual white hero dude who sounds like he had failed autitions for nearly every character in Supernatural. The excerpts werent very interesting, because he spent most of the time talking about his girlfriendwifelover or trying to paint a picture over the lazy graphics.I know this is someones work and Im honestly happy that theyre hopefully doing something they love, but so far I only see this game as a chance to improve on a pretty neato idea. This barely qualifies as a game. There is zero skill involved and hardly any meaningful decisions.  Seriously, this game is just a cycle ofClick to enter a roommaybe find an enemy. Click for ultra-simplistic turn-based combat.Click highlighted locations to see what loot you findDecide if you want to make anything from your loot using the clunky  clumsy crafting systemDecide if you want to use any itemsClick another roomHonestly, its that simple and repetitive.  Enemies get tougher as you progress, and you have the ability to craft better weapons, but its never very interesting. Dont waste your time on this. Absolutely needs more content.  Whats here is fine, but there are no choices to be made, no strategy to employ.  In one playthrough youll have the correct playstyle down rote, because its so simple.  Click, eat, click, craft, click eat....It feels like the funadmentals for a pretty good game.  But its not there yet. Hardcore difficulty is straight up a joke. The most annoying thing about this game and the only reason I cannot recommed buying  Skyhill. Literally impossible to play without the perk  Total mess  otherwise the game gives you hardly any loot. The hit chance mechanic doesnt make any sense also. How can I miss consistently if the game tells me I have 75 of hitting a target. Late game monsters are overpowered. How am I supposed to recover from double 25 points crit? Not to mentions bugs that ruin the experience.To cut a long story shortWhats the point in playing the game with casino RNG? Edit Tall man creature can literally do 40 crit damage you have 100 HP by default. Imagine retreating in order to restore some HP and this thing just performs a 40 HP drop-kick. Yeah, I dont have to imagine because it just happened to me. 19th floor and this is my death. This game seems to be a literal waste of time at this point. Master Survivalist, huh? The hardcore difficulty doesnt take any skill. Its all about luck. I know what to do, I know what to collect in order to survive, I know when to avoid and take the fight but it doesnt matter because you can die at any point when you get to the bottom floors starting from 30. For a good looking rogue-like game featuring turnbased combat with  weapon and food crafting and a bit of base building, it is totally unimaginable that they can actually made it this boring. SKYHILL turned out to be far weaker than the sum of its parts. 2 playthrough is all  I could suffer through and no more. Before buying it, I just watched the gameplay video and did not tried the demo, the video on youtube is quiet convincing. Playing it is another story. A hundred floors to explore sounded like a lot of fun but actually it was notmany rooms were empty. There are two things really wrong and bad about this game which were repeatedly criticized by many, many other reviews that gave it a thumb down firstly, there were so many different useless thingjunk that you can hardly craft any meaningful weapon from them when you most needed it because you keep getting scrap metal. Secondly, there was almost no story. If you count the one page comic as story than yes a bit story. The voice recordings and notes you collect in the game are inconsequential and made no sense. You could finish the game in 2 hours if you chose to play on Easy mode but for some reason the first time you play the Easy mode was disabled and only the Normal and Hard mode for you which was difficult AF and brutal AF. You could play this game many times for achievements but I just cant be bothered bad and meaningless story. All I have to say is, this game is extremely shallowcould be a good mobile game for kids and if you really want it get it on salea huge sale not some 25 because the priceentertainment ratio of this game is way off and not worth it. TlDR Game doesnt depend on the skill of the player rather than of luckSkyhill reminds me of chainsaw warrior but on the first glance it seems more fun . The fun ends when you die a couple of times because you encountered 10 mutants in a row or go down floor after floor and find nothing.I really tried to like it but any game that has such a kind of random map generation should atleast have a minimum amount of loot spawns and maximum amount of monster spawns otherwise you play for couple of hours and die over and over again.The combat is dull, only way to interact really is to choose between 3 points to attack which make just more or less damage but have higher or lower chance to hit.The visuals and the story is very good whatsoever, so the formula works better than in any other survival game since you have a goal to achieve in the end, that is reaching the lobby from the top floor.Try the game out, 1 hour is enough to let you see basicly everything the game has to offer. The gameplay is fun, I enjoyed it, but a game should be beatable trough the skill of the player and not only by luck. 4.510 Below average game I had to refund SKYHILL because it became very repetitive and gets old over a short amount of time.  Around the first 10 floors you face the same enemy then the second 10 floors you finally face another.  I think it would help to have a variety of enemies throughout the floors and increase their strength as you go down.  Also combat could be more exciting or have choices that really matter.  You can click on three different areas of the body but it does not make much of a difference and it does not cause a unique state such as stunknocked out with a head shot or to disable a limb. Skyhill is in a nutshell a rogue-like reversed endless tower.From Singleplayer perspectiv The game seems unfinished, to be more precise unpolished.The best weapon for most part are the Tonfas a LowTier weapon. Crafting HighEndTier weapons is nearly impossible, because there are far to less items to have the chance to craft something that satisfies, only with a small chance and when reaching like floor 10, its maybe possible to craft some high tier weap. But you really have to safe up the itemsTo use weapons there are specifiq stats needed for which is needed to spend points correctly after leveling up... but its doubtful that its possible to reach a lvl to be even able to use any HighTierWeaponsEven the level up system, just ugh, for lvl 20 there are over 100k exp needed and enemies giving at best around 150... tho there are only 100 floors and they are not respawning...In the loadingscreen picture the protagonists holds a shotgun and some enemies holding themself guns, why are they not craftablein-game?...i could go on, probably...In Conclusion This game is no good as Singleplayer. The most enjoyable part was to mess with the savegame till the game didnt want to start anymore! x,DBUTIf you are using LivestreamMode and having some viewers to interact with, things might look otherwise.Maybe it would be possible to get more items, enemies, etc.Although, seems there are some issues with the connectivity btw Skyhill and Twitch, the Livestream-FAQ link also not working.In Conclusion Questionable! You go through rooms and floors find scraps, food and monsters, upgrade your VIP hotel room and customize your weapons. Stay alive and dont die of hunger. Once the game mechanics are clear, the challenge says goodbye and boredom says hello. Best played in short doses, but would I recommend it to my Steam friends? - No, I would not. httpsteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id604575551 httpsteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id659160171 Unlocked all achievements! Tons of potential here but the game is poorly balanced requires more luck than strategy.   Honestly, this feels like an unpolished phone game. The main problem with this game is there is too much of not enough.The game has turn based combat - but there is barely any strategy to it other than picking which dice to roll. There is nothing actively happening in these fights to make the player feel interested. All you feel is frustration over your health ticking down when there is nothing you can actively do inside or outside the combat system to better yourself.The game has RPG stat elements  - but they are probably the lamest, most simplistic Ive ever seen. Leveling a character is so linear and obvious that it shouldnt make a player scratch his head any longer than 5 seconds to figure out what path to take largely dependant on what weapon the games RNG decides to give you early on. There isnt even any defense ratings for character or monsters, making the whole weapondamage system feel hugely simplistic and unrewarding.Theres a crafting system - its pretty bread and butter. The actual items you can create and variety isnt too bad really. But the way the game plays out just makes it another aspect that falls to the side as unrewarding, plagued by RNG happenstance, and rather pointless. Its true you will need to use it to some extent to make it to the bottom, but I doubt you would need to invest in much, which is good considering there is no active way to get materials you really need. In other survival games, you have areas that have greater or exclusive chances to wield certain items. This game its all at the drop of a hat, and it completely makes the player feel void of any real sense of achievement, because they never feel like they are actively surviving.The premise of the game sounds super neat - but in reality its such a hollow rendition of what the game promises on paper. You have to escape a hotel from the 100th floor and get to the bottom. When you realize that each floor has two... yes, two rooms on each floor, I think thats when it kicks in how lazy, barebones and unadventurous this game really is. Im also not sure what hotels these developers have been to, but this building barely even qualifies to be a crappy highrise in Newham. In the end , this needed to be fleshed out, in all areas, by a factor of 10. The price of admission makes it clear that theyre not even shy or are perhaps ignorant to have made such a minimalist and lacking game.",
        "summary": "The crafting system is more interesting for sure. As you progress in the weapons you can make, things get even easier. Item drops are notably sparse aside from basics like food and health. The voice acting in memoirs left behind seemed to be mildly engaging."

        "text": "This is a very mild recommendation. If you want a simple survival game that never really changes beyond some basic automation, this is the game for you. When I saw that there would be robots to command, I was enthused, but they cant do some core things, like farm for you. The game explicitly says that the robots are there to do the boring parts, but fishing and farming are hugely tedious, especially later in the game when the volume of needed items grows. Fundamentally, you can feel that this was a game in Early Access. New mechanics spring out of nowhere and are poorly supported, the narrative will have dramatic cutscenes that fizzle out in the next chapter, the twist comes out of nowhere and is meaningless, the last chapter is unpolished, theres a huge spike in resource demand in the late game without mechanics to support generating those resources, and the late game is clearly unoptimized, with loading and running the game both being difficult even on a solid computer.The core of the experience is mindless fun, but its clear that the EA development cycle left noticeable scars on the game. This is a most mild thumbs up for an ok but clearly flawed experience. To be honest survival games arent really my cup of tea and I really dislike the hardcore ones like rust, forest, ark, etc. They arent bad games but Im the type of gamer who likes to play my games slowly and at my own relaxed pace. I really hate a game that has a high sense of urgency and punishes me for my desired playstyle. So far Ive only played a few hours of I am future and really enjoying it. Its a cozy survival game that respects everyones pace and playstyle. Fruitsplantsvegetables are all over the place so its hard to die of starvation, materials are also abundant, crafting is not too complicated, cookingforagingfishing are also simplified. Its laid back but its also challenging and can even be hectic in its own way. Overall my whole experiences in the game are mostly positive so thumbs up for now. Few suggestionsfeedbacks I have with the game.- I wish I would be able to keep 99 of all the items or materials rather than 20, because it just take unnecessary storage space and I just end up throwing a lot of them out.- It would be cool to sell some of the items I dont need, because a lot of them just ends up as waste that accumulates over the surroundings.- Hunger really needs some tweaking.- Water bucket needs to be able to hold more water and atleast make the sprinklers automatic.- I wish there was a way to skip the fishing minigame entirely. It does get rather annoying if I have a lot of bait with me and plan to catch a lot of fishes.- Blue and black goo really needs to have more uses to them. I absolutely love this game!  I completely finished the first part of the story the part that has been released up to this point.  I loved it so much that I restarted the game and played it again as a woman when that update came out.  Ive already completed the Steam Achievements, or at least the ones so far - idk if they are going to add more when they create new content and open new areas.  I am anxiously awaiting for each new update, because I love playing this game so much.  They did such a great job with the story-line and the tasks I love completing checklists and kept the game challenging enough to keep me working towards my goals and always looking forwards to my next task. After playing almost for 4 hours on the last evening I can say1. It runs perfectly well on Linux2. It was hard to stop playing this game.I like the visual style. I like the unstressful gameplay and I like the progression. You always have something to do.Maybe Ill update the review if Ive played a few more hours.But normally I dont even review game. But I want this game to thrive, so here is my review - Its a solid pick for anyone who loves survival games but prefers a more relaxed pace. Whether youre crafting, farming, scavenging, or perfecting your base design, this game delivers a refreshingly laid-back experience. The art style is charming, and the soothing soundtrack complements the overall vibe. Highly recommended for players looking to unwind while still enjoying the satisfaction of building and thriving in a survival setting. I mean my review will probably get lost through all the other positives Im sure are coming but yeah, this game is pretty legit.Its designed well, it plays well, it looks and sounds good and its gameplay is relaxing and fun and engaging too.Its stable, its affordable, its unique and its just overal a good fricken game.I didnt experience any glitches or bugs or anything like that. Its got partial voice acting, great sound effects and music. Its writing is decent, its gameplay loop engaging, and overal yeah its just a good game. If youre a fan of farming sim games or survival games but wanted one that was more relaxing and casual then this is a great pick and a game this good in early access deserves some support and recognition.So if youre even a tiny bit curious or interested in this game, know going in, that its worth it and it wont let you down. But if this wasnt enough information for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel link below.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vuT5xvYgRDIOtherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely. Finally a survival sim that doesnt create difficulty with combat, does exactly what it says on the tin, and it even has a fishing minigame that DOESNT make me want to tear my hair out! Looking at you Stardew!Pros Cozy mode is a huge plus. Sincerely, as someone who plays a LOT of survival games and is a bit tired of edgy rugged gameplay, THANK YOU. Works well on older video cards FYI, Im still rocking a GTX 680 I know, I know - Christmas maybe and it plays fine on 60 FPS! Very bright and chill aesthetic. The only enemies are weeds and bugs that can turn into weeds. You craft bug spray to get rid of them, which is kinda genius lolCons Some clunkiness with the controls - Im using mouse and keyboard, I think controller support is to come later? - but nothing that would softlock or ruin the overall game experience. Some of the progression pathing isnt obvious you HAVE to fish in order to unlock some early necessities but its not hard to figure out  once you get far enough along youre pretty spoiled for resources. One awkward moment where a robot proclaimed her love for me, but she was okay with me letting her down gently. The automation is almost non-existent at this stage I built the robot but it got stuck almost immediately, so I would love to see more of thatmore improvements as the game develops.General Feedback Would love to see more character customization options because theyre quite lacking - hair colours, more styles, skin tones, maybe a different gender?? I feel like the story is following him as a character and not a self-insert like many survival games afford you, but I dont see a reason why he cant be more customizeable or more self-insert, or a she even. Wish I could scrap more things and had more places to gomore places I could explore and interact with, as it feels very limited right now. Would love more world lore about the moon and the main character and their involvementwhat happened to them. Would also love to see more accessibility features for my friends that need them, such as controller support, one-handed mode, colourblindness modes, and the ability to disable flashing effects I dont recall seeing any but just as a note for future. Would also love a weather cycle, a rain collector, solar panels, a way to customize or improve on the sleeping area, and capacitorsbatteries would be cool too. Robots that could garden and cook for me would also be swell!Looking forward to seeing what more this game has to offer I have really enjoyed this game so far!  My kinda calm, easy going playtime when Im trying to relax.  Ive pretty much done everything I can up to this point except some of the progression in the cooking stuff, which isnt really my thing, Ill admit, but its been really fun!   Looking forward to the next update!  Definitely a good one to pick up if you like the cleanup and create kind of gameplay! Have you ever wanted to play a survival game that didnt feel so gloom and doom?  Well, youve found it!  This turned out to be such a neat little game.  I loved the art style, and the bright cheerful look of the world even though everything has clearly gone to ----.  The mellow music made me feel like I was perpetually living my best lazy Sunday afternoon, coffee in hand, warm socks hugging my feet.. etc.  This game felt like a breath of fresh air compared to many survival games whos aesthetic is very grim, dark, and gritty.  It feels like the end of the world, but from the eyes of a person whos still got a little hope that there will be a better future ahead.  Heres what I loved about the gameMusic and visuals were greatCheerful in the face of hard timesFishing Disassembling parts felt satisfyingSmart storage  you can link boxes eventually have have them auto fillHelper buddiesBeautiful art styleEasy to loose real life hours.Eager to play more.Wish list for future updatesBoxes need more slotsStacks could go higherPin multiple recipes at onceFarmer minionWASD to move mapAbility to move all plants even the edible onesDIY fertilizerBetter farming Quite fun game even though it seems to have an identity crisis.   At this stage of Early access Nov 2023 I got about 12 hours of enjoyable gameplay before content ran out.With enough content for a couple of levels of upgrades for the various tools and tables this has a good experience to offer even at the current stage.   Graphics are nice, Music is good but repetitive and it seems relatively bug free.   Its essentially an apocalyptic gathering farm game. Take apart a toaster, screw by screw, cable by cable!Send a Drone daily to gather parts!Repel the corruption as it spreads to eat your stuff!Grow coffee beans, because coffee!Yeah, at this stage Id be happy to recommend this one.  Lets see where it goes. Fun game! Needs more content and balancing.---The minions could be really useful in a future update. My main complaints are  1. You cannot whitelistblack list the item they will collect. You either select SPECIFIC items or automatic selection. For example, I want to be able to set one of them to only get wood planks.  2. The path finding needs some love.  3. The minion engineers need also some higher level of intelligence. I want to be able to set conditions and actions for them- Not blindly assume they will figure-out what to do because they dont, they dont have any level of prioritization. This way automating stuff like electricity would actually be possible.On the rest of the game  1. The recipes are really cool and fun to discover. Feels rewarding and not over complicated. My only complaint is that some ingredients are needlessly monotonous to get, like drinkable water which many recipes require.  2. The art-style, atmosphere, environment are nice on the eyes.  3. QOL like send to storage button, directly accessing the main functionality of the machine instead of choosing between electricity and the machines main task, and others would make the game more pleasant.   4. Without a way of actually automating the electricity its impossible to get a reasonable amount of late game items with the printer. It takes too long to print them and you have to constantly restart the process when the electricity goes down This might be a bug.  5. Farming, in my opinion, needs balancing. The advanced beds are too expensive and dont actually help much other than growing the seed all day long, and again, they require electricity, which is a very valuable resource at the current state of the game.  6. Getting important items like the ones needed to create more minions feels, or are, impossible to get outside of the initial amount available. But Im sure this will change in later updates.---This game feels really nice to play and its clear the amount of effort the developers put into it. The story feels like a background story till basically the end of chapter one, but is nice and enjoyable. The minions is a very very cool idea and with some improvements can become a cooler aspect of the game. I really hope the devs move forward making them more powerful and allow for a really extensive automation throughout. In my opinion, its worth the price and more. Colorfull and chill.Very satisfying disassembling mechanics. At first had a problem with motion sickness, this setup worked for me- turn off smooth camera- turn off v-sync- set FPS to monitors max- setting graphics to ultra to add crispinessOverall pleasant and engaging. overall, fairly decent game. its a bit grindy, and there are three big coming soon wall sections blocking off areas full of transparent blue boxes- one below the starting area, and two across the bridge at the end of the current content. the game gets less polished as you get closer to the end of current content, and its clear that a lot of things have placeholders for future upgrades. the plot is that a seagull woke you from cryosleep by accident, you have amnesia and a cybernetic right hand. most of the progression focuses on cybernetic upgrades via saw and hammer. mostly you focus on farming, so you wont starve in the early game. the fishing is okay, but the process of gathering and boiling water so you can water crops is a bit of a chore. completing the bridge gets you to the current endgame area. you need to keep upgrading buildings, in order to get better resources to get the next set of stuff made. Nice game to cozy up with on a day off....looks like big plans ahead for more story too. Plays well on steam deck You start playing and just cant stop, you got things to do! Clear the mess, collect stuff, craft stuff, unlock stuff, go places!And yet its totally relaxed because you set your own goals and its quite easy to NOT starve or anything, so you can go exploring and unlock new things, new tools and new places. Sometimes it feels a bit weird to have only kind of artificial company and sometimes the sounds those companions make get on my nerves singing electronic voices are just not my cup of tea... but overall its a great game I love spending time with. Oh, and I really like the background and menu music.A clear recommendation! This game is so much fun it makes me happy to play.  No baddies to fight so far which is great as you can just get on and create your world.  Lots to do.  Lots to find out.  There are some critters to deal with but they are manageable so it doesnt spoil playing the game and they give you valuable resources.  I wanted a game that was relaxing to play and that wouldnt cause stress or anxiety.  There is enough of that in the real world.  I didnt want a game where you worried about dying all the time.  Yes you have to stay alive by eating and sleeping and you have to build things to improve your world and make life easier but so far it is just solving puzzles and collecting things.  Once you have the Crypto farm and can make money you can buy resources to build more things that you need.  Each item you create makes your life easier.  I like that I can switch off and relax. I got stuck on the fishing part not realising you had to click each section as the arrow turned to it.  Once I realised that the game got more fun with the extra food and resources.  Great game. Its a good survival game with depth and creativity behind it... but its not casual as the reviews say... In the couple hours I played I felt a constant pressure to feed myself, a constant race against time before the food bar would drain, and constant anxiety dealing with overflowing inventory. Its not chill... its anxiety ridden.But its well made, and different in its own way to all the other survival games... sorta. Its just not going to be for me... I bought it to play my main genre of survivalcraftbuild in what was supposed to be a more relaxing environment... the feelings this gives, I might as well just stick with the games I already play that arent telling people they are chill.It is a good game, well worth the price and if you enjoy the genre, its very well made... but its a lot of anxiety. It really is. Love the cozy functionality that turns off the worms attacking my stuff and the character needing to eat. I completely can focus on whatever goals I set for myself, or the ones I receive on the game. This is a great game.   Got in the sale and was well worth the low price.   Once youve finished the main story 14 hours there isnt much to do so looking forward to the other areas being opened up. As of February 2024 the start of the game has a nice hook. It doesnt bring anything fresh to the genre - its exactly what you expect a single-player builder set in the apocalyptic future to look like. Well, no zombies - but other than that...The mid-late game is still missing as of right now but theres enough promise to earn a tentative yes from me.",
        "summary": "The core of the experience is mindless fun, but its clear that the EA development cycle left noticeable scars on the game. The last chapter is unpolished, theres a huge spike in resource demand in the late game without mechanics to support generating those resources. loading and running the game both being difficult even on a solid computer."

        "class": "negative",
        "text": "I normally write massive structured essays to share my opinion of a game, but Im tired, boss, so this will have to do. I want to like this game, I really do. The core premise is right up my alley - but the gameplay itself is just so damn tedious. I played it to scratch the itch left by Dysmantle. And while fundamentally I am Future is very similar - there are several misses in gameplay design that make it irritating rather than satisfying, from constantly running from one end of a perpetually expanding territory broken up by loading screens elevators to another, to one object requiring different items to construct depending on where you are on the map, just to make things more challenging from a blueprint that connects all your storage chests in a single network - but leaves out the storage areas for large building materials and the ones associated with workshops, to access to areas one can explore and loot with a drone being limited both by the drones battery AND the day of the week. Ah, yes, a park that keeps business hours in the post-apocalypse. Sounds like the company where a friend of mine works.As you can see, I sunk 24 hours into this game. It DID suck me in at first, Ill give it that. But while running to my workbench for the umpteenth time because I was missing  one lousy microchip and that is the only place you can craft it, I simply stopped, said I dont want to do this anymore, closed and uninstalled.If you want a mindless post-apocalypse crafting game - skip this and play Dysmantle. It has its flaws, and some major QOL is paywalled behid the DLCs, but its definitely nowhere as irritating as this.If you want a cozy crafting game with some brains to it, the publisher who released this game TinyBuild also released Graveyard Keeper. Which, to be fair, also involves a lot of running back and forth, and key NPCs can only be approached on one day of the week, but automation is much simpler, and, once you unlock the speed potion, youll just be zooming around the map.The ability to put a moustache and cat ears on a robot is nice, though, thumbs up for that. I really wish there was a neutral rating option, the game is a bit of a mixed bag and while it has a lot going for it, I also found it lacking in many areas.Since Im forced to choose, the reason I give it a negative recommendation boils down to the early access promises and the current state of the game. In the early access blurb on the store page, the developer states that they ..wouldnt like to keep the game in Early Access for too long... and Our approach would rather be to underpromise and overdeliver rather than vice versa.. At the time I bought the game it had already been in early access for just shy of a year, so Id expect it to be mostly done given the devs description. I even looked up the roadmap and at a glace it appeared to suggest the game was near completion. In reality however the game is very unfinished.  The map is already tiny, yet everywhere I go I run into Coming Soon signs which block access to unfinished areas, such areas even existing near the starting area on the first roof. There are additionally other places the game feels unfinished, but keep reading for more on each point.Visuals - Stylistically the visuals are great! The devs know what they are doing here, going with a simple casual-cute lowpoly style and sticking with it. I Am Future is well polished in this area, stylized visuals definitely being one of the developers strengths. The visual design of the game could also be described as cute and hip post-apocalyptic, which works with the theme. Great! Audio - Nothing to complain about. Cutesy audio that fits the theme. Occasional bugs.Story - The story is ok but a bit samey same. You have woken up from cryosleep on the roof of a flooded city far in the future. Your character has amnesia and you begin to find NPCs in the form of digitised consciousness who claim to know you from past lives. Its ok I guess, and fits the theme, but the execution makes them unrelatable and they dont have much character beyond This NPC was a chef and now they inhabit a fridge. TLDR I found the character building landed a bit flat and found myself skimming their dialogue instead of feeling invested. Typos are also fairly common and there are some weird bugs where NPCs appear to want to speak to you but have nothing to say. For some reason speaking to a specific one, your character begins the conversation by saying goodbye? Bugs.Gameplay - The game turns out to be more of a chore simulator than survival, a chore simulator, with backtracking! Taking things apart is fun for a while but gets old quick as you constantly have to leave objects unfinished because you are missing the right tool. It is unsatisfying and you quickly find yourself doing roof-chores in tight little circles. One of the biggest chores is inventory management. You have a lot of items you need to carry and not a lot of space to do it. You will literally spend half your playtime managing your inventory, storage inventory, and cleaning up the mess minions make set them to a dedicated storage or they will put everything everywhere. To make things worse there are items that just start to pile up and no good way to manage them, for example seeds and common ingredients dropped by the slugs that spawn to attack the plants every night. A lot of elements lack automation, for example you can automate a pump to pump water a trivial task and even desalinate it on a timer, but you still have to carry water around your base manually, 3 units at a time in your pail in order to water your plants. There is a sprinkler which needs electricity to run and waters within a radius, but you still have to carry several loads of water across your base with your pail to FILL it. TLDR There are a lot of gameplay elements that just dont feel very well thought out. The Gameplay loop is very grindy with far too much walking around  inventory management, and after a while, playing the game begins to feel like an endless loop of tedium.Size - The game area is tiny! At first you feel like there is a lot to do because the game keeps you busy doing chores, but in the current state of EA you literally have one large roof plus an adjacent mini-one which is quite a bit smaller with very few points of interest. The entire game basically just takes place on one large skyscraper roof. Thats your play area. Youll literally just walk around it in circles every day doing chores, disassembling detritus, and killing weeds.Bugs - So many bugs! From getting stuck in strange places, to Minions getting stuck and collapsing your power grid, minions getting stuck in baths, to autosaves during certain actions causing frustrating mayhem, the bugs just seem endless. To their credit, the devs have managed to keep the game itself stable I havent experienced a single crash in the 15 or so hours Ive played so far. The bugs though, while most are minor, are a constant.Conclusion - My experience in the 15 or so hours Ive played is that I Am Future feels unfinished as well as unpolished. I had fun at the start before discovering that the core gameplay loop is all busywork, and things started to get less interesting. I started to expand my base, explore the roof, and work on quest objectives, but it feels like as soon as I started to make headway I hit the limits of the current EA game. There were coming soon blockades around every corner, most of the drone map minigame is locked and those are just text based encounters! Why are they not done!?, and the huge time-consuming bridge building project the game sets you on for hours lets you explore a small secondary roof, which aside from resources is pretty dull and empty. On this secondary roof you have to do more chores, before the game basically tells you COMING SOON. Thats all there is The game is highly unfinished despite developer promises and its relatively simple scope.Areas of improvement for the Developer- Make autosave faster, not interrupt player during actions  fishing  etc, and let the player customise the frequency.- Fix minions, they always get stuck or cause mayhem. Add item filter options for each storage box so that minions put things in the right place, the current implementation is frustratingly bad.- You promised that the game wouldnt be in EA for too long, yet it looks like after a year your still less than halfway done, judging by locked areas and coming soon signs.- The core gameplay loop is far too grindy.- Inventory management needs an overhaul. This might be a fun survival game eventually but the hunger drain makes the game far too tedious currently. You spend more time feeding yourself than anything, there is an option to turn off health decay when you are hungry which essentially removes hunger altogether, by doing this though it makes large parts of the game pointless. This seems to be a long term issue that many have complained about but the devs did nothing about the decay rate, they just gave an option to remove it completely. As sad as I am to do this, I cant recommend this game as it is. The title promised a cozy game, and while the start was great, it ended up being an experience so frustratingly stressful due to how clunky storage, and automation has been, as well as some design decisions that make very little sense.The early game is the better part of it you explore, discover, disassemble manually and fight against threats that would prevent you from surviving the ordeals that loom upon you a critical lack of food and health.The more you go, the more youre encouraged to make use of different tables, and crafts that use all the things from your disassembling endeavors. This is where the game shines the most, because of how the world around you can be actively used for progress.However, the more you go, the more you realize that the game has scaled too much from its original goals storage doesnt work properly, is laggy when switching from chest to chest, robots dont detect some storages properly, trash storage isnt counted as storage for some reason and is the best storage for single items in the game, so you cant quick stack your items on those from any chestcrafting table or robots do not insert items in those...There are a lot of weird, frustrating quirks in how everything is done, where some items can be crafted instantly, but some others require you to make giant machines that take ages to make a single item. Some crafts require 3m30 to make ONE item, where crafts can require you to have upwards of 20 of one, for one repaircraft! And of course, upgrading the machine you make them in... does NOT make the crafts faster. So what do you do? You make more machines! Well, tough luck, you have very little room to do so and you need those items to bridge the gaps between places for power.Speaking about power, another example would be the recharging stations, where those take more room than any other machine in there, but somehow requires you to build it early on, on a roof that has very little space to move and do so. Smaller stations accomodating one robot each would be much better suited for the early point you get those, rather than those gigantic wastes of space that prevent you from automating early on.About automation, theres some of the issues I talked about early on, but theres also very little the robots can do, especially early on. You have to unlock quite a few of their capabilities, and even when you do, you need specific upgrades to the tower to get their better ones. So by the time that you ARE unlocking them, youll have done all the painful work that these wouldve helped a lot with.There are also some weird things related to the controls this was designed with a QWERTY keyboard in mind, so rebinding some of the movement was possible, but some of the UI cant be reassigned. For example, Q by default is Move Left and A is Previous TabTurn Camera Left, following the QWERTY design. But if you reassign Q to Turn Camera Left and A to Move Left, the Previous Tab bind stays at the QWERTY A, so Q in the AZERTY layout! As much as I want to recommend this game out there, its riddled with issues from its core design to the small details, making it hard to truly like without having to suffer all kinds of caveats by design.Which is a shame, because at its core, this has the potential to be a really fun and cozy game, with tons of somewhat educational ways to disassemble items and teach how to salvage parts from things that seem to be completely busted in the first place. But in this state? Im sorry, this is not a fun game, especially in the later stages where storage and damage repairs become a chore rather than the promised cozy survival. I wanted to like this game, I really did. Bought it during EA and now that 1.0 came out, it didnt really improve on things I was hoping for.If I had to describe this game in 2 words, it would be slow and dull.It has a great game idea, its nicely polished, but it just feels oddly unfulfilling compared to other survivalcrafting games Ive played.Edit 1121 To Response to Dev Comment I wouldnt say it was a bad experience, just not my cup of particular cup of tea. Im sure this game will do great and be loved by a lot of people, so Im rooting for you guys! But if you want some feedback on what I would change, here it goes1 Remove the directional minigames or quick time events from disassembling objects. Pressing Left, then Right really doesnt feel intuitive to saw something, especially having to do it over and over and over again. Or include an Quick Dismantle option that will remove lumbersheet metal after 1 second of interacting with it.2 After taking apart certain objects like the kettle or microwave like 3 times, just include an option to quickly dismantle everything. It was fun doing those a few times but got really repetitive after a while.3 Food system needs a rework. It drains too fast and the 1 benefit it offers is annoying to keep up. I think it would be more rewarding if each food gave you a timed buff, like Jam makes you run faster, fish patties gave your more strength to carry more objects, salads could make you dismantle objects instantly for a short time, etc.4 For cooking recipes in the pot, when adding an ingredient, highlight other food objects in your inventory that pairs with it. Im sure the intent is for players to try and figure out recipes, but honestly, placing one item in and out over and over until I found something that matches just felt like a waste of time. I bet a lot of people just went right away to a wiki to look up matching foods.5 Maybe this is some OCD mindset, but I found it disheartening when I finally got an upgrade to dismantle something like a soda machine that I could only remove the plastic or screws, and then needed a further upgrade to dismantle it. Its like yippie, I can finally get rid of this to clear out this section and...oh wait...aw man!. Objects like those should be in reverse order of dismantling, like you need a piston hammer or steel saw blade or something you get later on to FIRST needing to dismantle it, cause that way, you know you will be able to remove something entirely if youre trying to clear out a certain space.6 Revamp the Fishing. Either make it reel in on one click, or a more interesting minigame. Having to click on 3 random spots in a circle feels extremely boring. Also, when catching a fish, there should be a Fish again? option if you have more of the same bait to fight immediately. Or maybe after catching so many fish, you can just craft fish nets, load it up with bait, throw it in, come back after a day, and collect all the fish that you had bait for.7 Storages should have twice as many slots and crafting tables workbench, campfire, etc should pull resources from storages. Like its nice that they have their own storage, but I found it really, really repetitive that I was constantly going around 4 different storages to put items away. If not that, I would absolutely love an option where maybe you could hold down interact on a chest, and itll automatically pull similar items from your inventory and store it in the storage.8 Why can your character only carry 1 wood or sheet metal at a time? I know theres a food buff to pick up an extra piece, but it feels limiting for no reason except for in my mind to pad out play time.Now Im only scratching the surface of the game from what Ive played, and I bet a lot of these suggestions Im throwing out probably get resolved with bot minions or further character upgrades, but I just the start of the game could benefit by chopping things out with some quality of life changes. Or honestly, creating a Skill Tree system could also alleviate all my suggestions if those benefits could come quickly for the character. I think I Am Future is a charming game. It has a solid artistic style. The music is nice and there isnt really much pressure in terms of a survival crafting game... in the beginning. TLDR At first, I enjoyed it and have a satisfying time scrapping and crafting. By midlate game everything just feels tedious. Task burnout is real because even with the minions If they ever work right it becomes a standard cookie cutter supply chainsurvivalcrafting game.Thats about where my positive notes end. This all goes beyond the Early Access issues. That will be fine for some and not others. Most of the late game experience is tedious and slow. Despite having access to minions I dont find them useful or practical. My hope is 1.0 will solve a lot of the QoLOptimization issues.The minions never really worked for me and I had to just shut them off. I had buildings disappear after moving from the fishing zone back up to the main roof.The fishing mini-game is boring and slow.The deconstruction mini-games are just not enjoyable despite being easy and simple. Inventory management and space comes at a costly premium. The fridge robot doesnt link with the inventory sharing upgrade. Upgrades for tools show very little practical improvement. BuildingsItemsMinions dont exactly fit very well on the grid system with odd gaps.Trying to manage the worm enemies is a chore and rather tedious to deal with. ProgressionTask tracking lacks details. I had to lean on the wiki a lot to figure out some of the quest goals. Its not really a cozy game when I as a player are just soooo busy trying to run around and manage everything.The power management system drives me nuts with trying to set up power line networks with those dumb power polls. Trying to link power nodes. Soon my base looks like a cluttered industrial complex and not in the good way.Id like to see a better supply chain experience, one where It scales but progressively gets more hands off. Id like to see a revamped power management system. Id like item placement to be more fluid with the environment. Finally, Id like to have better ways to manage the worm enemies going into earlymid game. I really tried to like this game, but its lacking a lot of QoL. The inventories need better sorting  navigation. Crafting doesnt necessarily pull from chests, but there is an upgrade that lets you find which chest you need and THEN it pulls from it idk its a mess. I havent found a way to delete things, but there is a Recycling bin that you can store a seemingly infinite amount of 1 singular item but you cant pull from these while crafting. EnteringExiting the relatively small  detailed map for the drone flight takes up to 10 seconds for me, minor issue but still adds to being annoying.If you dont have a plan and are inexperienced, you can easily use up all of your resources without an easy way to replenish which leads to a lot of waiting or mind-numbing fishing. Even when you do know what youre doing, the resource situation is a little clunky to keep up with. Currently cant recommend. The game loop is a series of increasingly tedious fetch quests. Each of the quests are hard blocks to progress. This extends gameplay, but not in a good way since its ultimately masking a lack of content. I also found the game environment to feel very hollow and lonely rather than cozy. In a bit less than 10 hours of game play I unlocked every possible content and finished the current game story. After finishing the story there is no driver to keep playing and the chances that you want to start again are very low. The game has potential but there are some really not enjoyable aspect to it- getting food in a reliable way is very far into the gameplay. They should improve food availability or hunger management at the start of the game like provide some starting food supplies or sources.- the fishing mini game gets boring and actually annoying very fast as you will have to grind it for some specific resources. Just make it automatic after you reach something like 100 fishes. - there is only one type of mob and it will generate a completely useless amount of resource that you can not dispose of. Just create a system to sell unused resources.- the helper bots are useless as they are very inaccurate in their behaviour like for example collecting resources. Developers should improve the instructions that you can give to the bots.- some machines that produce certain key resources are very slow and this does not add anything to the game experience. Just make the machine produce as fast as the main character does almost instantaneous. - there is a super annoying loading screen between the main area and the fish  water area that will make you swear to god because you have to go back and forth hundreds of times to have some farming going. Just put the damned water on the roof top like with an already existing pump.- to create the best food recipes you will need a lot of water. but guess what, to produce drinkable water you need COAL! And the production of coal requires grinding of wood. How is it possible that a guy that can build a flight drone and automated bots, still needs COAL to produce drinkable water? Just introduce a desalination machine.- every machine you will create will need electric energy. Guess what there is not an end game source of electricity. Your only way to produce energy is to compost biomass at several composter because your machine will burn it very fast. Just introduce other sources of energy like solar panel or with other type of resources like the shit the mobs leave behind that is currently completely uselessAside from this the game is almost relaxing and enjoyable.I would not suggest you to purchase the game in the current status as- the developer can clearly still improve it but they could lose the driver to do it- it is quite expensive for the current amount of game content Not really any fun gameplay loops more like a chore simulator for food management. Story missions are just clearing space to explore pretty much which feels like a mobile game. Definitely needs more time to cook in development. So I really do want to recommend this game, and the first few hours are quite enjoyable, but the problem is that the entire game becomes tedious to a point that isnt enjoyable by the end. The real problem is that the game doesnt respect your time and needs to cut in half the wall clock hours needed to complete the game, if not more. Right now, I would say that you get the experience of the game after a few hours and the rest is just something to do if you feel like being a completionist, not that the game gets better or more fullfilling. The slog at the end of the game I really only finished to be able to make this review.The game -is- good, and I -did- have fun with it, but several times it felt like the balance of the games bottlenecks and limited resources didnt actually add anything to story, gameplay, or overall experience but instead just made the game take longerbe slower1 This game has 0 accessibility options, and that is a HUGE issue.2 This game doesnt respect your time enough. The robots are a nice addition, but that only allows you to slightly tread water, not to actually fully automate things.3 The game is basically a collection of mini-games for gathering resources, social points, fishing, and building, all of which become tedious after the 3rd time you do them. There needs to be unlockables fairly early that allow you to automate ALL of the mini-games. Honestly, I think just having an accessibility option to bypass them completely would make the game way less frustrating to play after the first few hours and make it possible for some gamers who cant do the required actions for some of the mini-games dancing, fishing, and listening in particular4 The game has hitches even on a near top of the line system like mine that5 Food crafting is super random and doesnt help you at all, you essentially have to look up a list to be able to figure out all the combos it wants you to find. It could easily highlight ingredients that go into recipes you havent unlocked if you have them visible6 Storage UX is clunky, the store all button shouldnt move on the screen even when boxes are different sizes wont make sense to new player7 The social system feels like it is 23x harder per person to cap out than it should be8 The it is awkward to get large physical items from the ground level up to the main level, There should be a way to automate this and it needs to be early 9 The map should indicate to you which locations you have visited before10 fully automated tasks should be possible like farming biomass to convert to other items or to cook a single dish or craft a single item like the floor tile11 the UIUX of upgrading the miner, sprinkler, and battery were both non-obvious for me until I looked at the holes in my blueprints. The upgrade button is hidden when you look at them after they are set up and wired up.12 The achievements are a bit silly in that 1 you can Miss in your first playthrough and takes quite a while to get to if you do biomass related to not spoil 13 time doesnt go fast enough when in sleep, which could really help speed up the wall-clock time of a lot of things14 Mining and printing are both at least 2x longer than they need to be 14 the robots dont have an option to pick naturally growing biomass and plants, nor to kill the bad plants This was pretty difficult to click on not recommended. I was close to click on recommended. But...Lett me start with the bad, then on to the good below.The BadThe game is extremely slow paced and grindy. The resources feel one-dimensional. Even after 7 hours of play-time I did not feel that there was decent tiering in the resources. I kept collecting the same thing over and over again.While there seems to be some kind of progression in the qualitycomplexity of resources it is either extremely limited or very, very, very far down into the game where you get access to them. The first machine you get the Mechanical Press feels useless because the materials it produces are found in abundance.The next step is a Resource Printer which feels badly paced as well. The initial resourcesmaterials you can produce in it take an eternity to do so, and the upgrade to the next level with more interesting materials feels unattainable.Some advancements are gated in that you must retrieve a very specific item for that unlock. This can be a good idea but in this game it just doesn feel right. Some of those items are found in shops, shome in the world, some in vending machines. It took me by surprise to see one of them in a vending machine. Those vending machines also require very special items to buy the items again. And it just feels unnatural to buy a syringe for a couple of berries. Especially since the game has a currency.I ended up hunting for those very special items all the while looting the bog-standard items that were available since the game-start.Finally, there is the base cleanup. It feels like this is the main goal of the game. You start in a messy area and you are forced to clean up to have room to put your machines. I would be inclided to accept this were it not for the fact that you cant clean up everything without the proper tools. And for the proper tools you need the aforementioned special items. This leads to a situation where the base is for a long time cluttered with junk. Until it can be cleaned up you need to upgrade the tools. This would be fine if it would be grouped into different areas, so that you could clean up one area first with basic items, then expand once new tools become available. But the junk is randomly scattered across the base so in the beginning you will always bump into small leftovers taht you cant clean up just yet.The GoodI still played for almost 8 hours. So it cant be that bad. It is indeed pretty relaxing. There is no stress, survival elements are there but not overly punishing. Heck, you can survive almost indefintely on an empty stomach.The user interface is simple and comfortable with the only minor gripe being the automatic camera movement. Its still good. Ive seen way worse. Just slightly irritating.Many tasks in the game use two or three key-presses which makes the tasks less repetitive. It is just enough to be more than a single key-press without it becoming annoying.One thing that is really well done is the linking between storage crates. It needs to be researched, but once done it makes it very easy to organise crates and to access anything from everwhere. It is a system that I have not yet seen in another game. And it works really well.There seems to me some lorestory about the world. But I could not discover much in the first 7 hours.ConclusionThe game is really relaxing and slow paced. If this is your cup of tea, by all means go for it. The main reason why I did not recommend it is because of how grindy it feels. This is very subjective. After playing I Am Future for 8 hours straight, it started to feel less like fun and more like work.Ill make a quick breakdown of my main issues with the game     Progression Really slow and every task feels like a chore until late in the game.     Movement Just boring. Moving is too slow and its hard to tell collision boxes for objects on the map. In a game where youre constantly going from one spot to another and dodging things, this gets old quickly.     UI Clunky and dated. Not the worst look, but inconsistent for example, sometimes ESC is used to exit a menu and other times its right-click. I feel like controls in general need an improvement.     Building Just meh. Setting up and moving things around could be more intuitive for this kind of game.     Crafting Needs an overhaul. The filters dont help much, and scrolling through many options to find something is a pain.     Farming Repetitive, demanding multiple boring steps.     Gathering Grindy, made even worse the by slow movement and the weird rule for certain resources of only moving one of them at a time.     Inventory management Messy. Youll often end up having to access multiple storages to get something simple done.     Automation More annoying than actually helpful. Theres no automation for crafting, only gathering. The other two options for robots are virtually useless.     Fishing minigame Not gonna lie, its one of the worst Ive seen in video games.I usually love games like this, so giving it a thumbs down feels really odd. The game is good, but it needs more polish. Im gladly changing my review if things get better through the Early Access. For now, I consider it to be a has potential, but not there yet situation. Dont get me wrong, its a fun game, if it was a mobile game. And the fun lasts 2 days. There is not much progress in terms of story and overall progression of buildings is slow. Automatization goes slow as well. Its kinda like satisfactory, and the adventures of Homescapes on mobile, where you have to clear out space to continue etc.Kinda hollow, kinda meh. Its ok if you have nothing else to play, but I cant recommend it like OMG, play this game Got it cheap, got hooked, but theres not enough flesh on it. Took me about 15 hours to do everything available. Although the gameplay is addictive, it gets really repetitive after a couple of hours. The mission pointers are somewhat vague and the dialogues with the NPCs are buggy, so you are never really sure of what youre supposed to be doing. The devs released a roadmap, but no word of when the rest of the content will be released. Id say the game is very 610 but it uses crypto as its currency so 510.When I think cozy I think easy, at your own pace. I Am Future seems to view it as easy, slow. The game does a lot to casually waste your time- bad load times, slow interfacing, a lot of mechanics are time-gated. And a lot of the mechanics serve little to no purpose.I sunk a bunch of resources into opening a location that refreshes its resources whenever it rains. After 40 ingame days it has rained genuinely once, when it was tutorialized to do so, hours before I unlocked said location. People complained about the hunger drain in a previous patch, but as someone who played both before and after the patch I dont really know what they were complaining about. Food and farming in general barely serves any purpose because it vastly outproduces what you need and you cant sell the excess. The food doesnt spoil, you dont have any extra buffs from eating specific meals.You can build little minions but their pathing is either secretly limited or blatantly atrocious- I set several to gather resources and I saw a single drone leave the starting area once, where its pathfinding then broke and it just stood in place. Which means if you want stuff from the adjacent roof you have to run back and forth yourself.Theres a number of things that talk about self defense, but there arent enemies in the game that attack things. Theyll eat naturally occurring plants that just respawn anyway, but they cant attack you or your stuff. Just another example of the game providing you a worthless resource sink under the guise of a useful option.Maybe you think Im being too critical of something that labels itself as cozy, but I dont think trying to evoke a relaxed vibe is an excuse for mediocrity. The description is misleading as this game is neither relaxing, nor cosy. You are constantly hungry and trying to stop your base being taken over by toxic weeds. The game is non stop grinding for very little reward. It may change and evolve as developers work through the game mechanics but currently, you slog your guts out to achieve... Not much. I have spent 18 hours gathering resources and have just become more and more confused by what Im trying to achieve.If the game were multiplayer then it would work, but as a single player, its just repetitive and the base layout, being so small and pokey, does not allow room to customise my area for improved production. Im glad I bought this on sale. I must say, the video makes it look way more fun and casual than it really is. Cant recommend a game I cant finish. Theyve been saying soon for a simple bug to Earl not letting you finish the game. But no, we apparently have to wait until their giant update is done, whatever it is. We dont know because they dont communicate it. Hotfixes simply arent a thing with this dev team it seems. As of 6272024 the game still has finite inventory with no way of easily disposing of excess items, like worms that will build up constantly if you choose to farm.  The game has some promise, but if inventory is still a problem nearly a year after early release, then spend your money elsewhere. Sometimes you watch a teaser trailer and you imagine that this is exactly the game of your dreams... And then the game comes out and its just meh. For me this is how it went with I Am Future.The game has like 2-3 hours of somewhat interesting progression, and then it just tells you well, these are all the mechanics we could come up with, now enjoy 20 more hours of grinding with no progression whatsoever.I cannot comprehend how to enjoy playing this game. Everything feels like an afterthought - the interfaces were not designed with the 1.0 mechanics in mind, but they were also not redesigned to incorporate them. So its all feeling kind of just bolted on. Like, theres probably a way to move your buildings around once you built them, but I couldnt find it. To move the NPCs around you need to go into 1. build menu, 2. switch to the library tab, 3. press the weirdly placed move button in the NPCs box.To build new buildings you can bring resources one by one, but to upgrade a building you gotta have everything at once.Sometimes an item will be marked as being sold in a store, but its not actually there, because its locked behind getting such an item in game, and its just never explained. Some quest items go straight into some database instead of your inventory, and you are only given a popup that it has happened the quests dont get updated, so you might accidentally vacuum it up and then spend three more hours pointlessly looking for said items all across the map.I started the 1.0 version hoping to finish the full game, but I ran out of steam halfway through. I cant bring myself to continue, its so boring.",
        "summary": "The core premise is right up my alley - but the gameplay itself is just so damn tedious. If you want a mindless post-apocalypse crafting game - skip this and play Dysmantle. It has its flaws, and some major QOL is paywalled behid the DLCs."

        "text": "Stanley sat in front of his computer. He was ordered to press a thumbs up button and write a positive review for a game that had been released just a few days prior. Having no prior knowledge about gaming, since hes only at most accustomed to just pushing buttons, Stanley pondered the title of said game. The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe. What a weird title. And why does it contain his own name? Surely this has nothing to do with him, because he was just Stanley, pressing buttons when demanded. Nothing was ultra deluxe about him pressing buttons. Not in any way at all. What even is the meaning of ultra deluxe? Coming to the conclusion that it was not his job to ponder such questions and instead press some more buttons, Stanley typed away on his keyboard, understanding non of the words he was tasked to write. Surely theyll make sense to someone else. Someone of greater intellect than him. Someone who truly cared about the words he would be about to send off into the vast internet ether, for others to read and enjoy and understand. Stanley, now happy with his work, clicked on the blue Post review button. Another job well done. Got stuck between two objects, waited 5 minutes for the narrator to speak, realised it was a bug. 1010 game. Did you get the broom closet ending? The broom closet ending was my favorite! I didnt like the FPS section was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess From the ashes of depravity rises the phoenix of quality. How else to describe The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe? Such a revolutionary step forward in the lineage of one of the most beloved game properties of all time! The additions and changes made to this expansion will surely resonate in the annals of the history of all media ever made. It is perhaps true to say that no mistakes are forever etched in stone, for the stone into which the Stanley Parable was carved has itself been transmuted, offering a message of hope to those who have ever erred in their judgement. You are not beyond redemption. You may change, and you may become more, so much more than you were before. If there is any message to be taken from The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, it is this... what a fortune, a privilege, a joy it is to have had such an experience it leaves me hopeful that as a community  as a world, there is time for us to become our greatest selves, as great as we ever could dream of in our wildest, most ambitious visions for a brighter future. Deluxe edition of perhaps one of the most original games in the modern world history of video games.After reading this review, Stanley was struck by its depth, gave it a thumbs up, and went about his business.Stanley also hovered over the hidden text at the bottom, but it didnt contain any useful information.For some reason, Stanley decided that reading the next hidden text would make more sense than the previous one.Stanley also decided that he had not spent enough time on the empty information in the hidden text and therefore decided to read the next text.Stanley read this text predictably. Therefore, he can consider himself a champion in consuming empty information. Well Stanley, I have a couple more lines of completely meaningless text for you.Completely empty and stupid text for Stanley. Haha, Stanley reads stupid texts and wastes his time!Stanley continues to read meaningless texts even when he is called stupid!Look, Stanley will also read the same messages!An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.A completely stupid and longer empty message for Stanley.An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.An absolutely empty and stupid Stanley for message.An absolutely stupid and empty message for Stanley.After wasting his time, Stanley decided to award this review and go about his business. Still, this review made Stanley smile and made his day a little better, despite the fact that he was called stupid I think the narrator is a really nice guy and is not long winded nor does he drone on. An outstanding model of a human being if ever there was one. In fact when you consider the common facilities that go into narration, one should really look inward on themselves and reflect on the very nature of their own existence. Though what is it to merely exist? To Narrate for others? To simply observe? To spew your opinions like a burst pipe? No. I think the true purpose of man can be easily summed up as follows a- This games message literally could not have hit at a better time in the games industry. With buggy, unfinished, and over promised games coming out left and right, sequels trampling on games legacy for wealth. This game stands as a work of art critiqueing and asking hard questions of this industry as a whole. Bucket out of 10, the end is never the end, will play again in ten years.

I originally wasnt going to write a review, since I assumed that this would be universally beloved and have nothing but positive reviews, which is the case for the most part. However, scrolling through reviews, I did find a popular one that was overwhelmingly negative, and at first glance, thought it was a joke in the style of the game. The more I read, though, the more I realized that it was serious, and several comments on that review thanked them for persuading them not to buy it. This is an egregious error, and I want to assure you that if you enjoyed the older versions of The Stanley Parable, you will absolutely enjoy this new version as well. Its got loads of new content that is very much in line with the style and humor of the original, and I was blown away multiple times by the size and scale of the offerings this is also in light of the fact that I know I have not seen everything there is to offer in this new version. If youve never played this game before, I can put it to you like this. If you are a fan of video games as an artistic and interactive medium, you need to experience this. Extraordinarily unique, oftentimes hilarious, and always delightful, surprising you constantly. I cant emphasize enough how much this game will surprise you at every corner, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I wouldnt look up any videos or guides, or anything that could potentially spoil it for you. The only way, really, to play this game is to experience it for yourself. After playing this game for myself, and giving it another try, I saw that it was much more than I once thought. I had learned to love this version of the game instead of the previous. I also appreciate the fact that they took my review into consideration and put a skip button in. It made the game complete. Stanley decided to betray the narrator, and logged onto Steam to create a review. It then suddenly dawned on Stanley that he couldnt muster the correct words to type down, as he only knew what to type based on what he was told. This was a frustrating situation for Stanley as he had never experienced such troubles in all his days working in the office, well at least not until today. However to both the narrators and Stanleys own surprise, he left a thumbs up review for The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, as despite his numerous complications and suffering throughout his journey, Stanley was still happy. found that narrator chap quite charismatic.2k hours update still think the narrator is just as charming as when i first purchased the game, if not more so. My relationship with the bucket really took off after a few hours of gameplay. I placed my entire faith in it and ultimately it lead me one one of the craziest and influential adventures of my entire gaming career. I could only hope that future games have such personable and caring buckets. My lack of an actual bucket in my everyday life leaves me feeling empty and depressed. --- Graphics --- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it MS-DOS--- Gameplay --- Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Watch paint dry instead Just dont--- PC Requirements --- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer--- Grind --- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboardsranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding--- Audio --- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Im now deaf--- Story --- No Story Some lore Average Good Lovely Itll replace your life--- Price --- Its free!

This is basicly, breaking the 4th wall - the game, but even that wont do it justice. It is a one of a kind experience among countless games you can find on steam. If you have played the original, then you know what to expect and yet you will still be surprised by all the new stuff, if you did not play the original, then thats all the more reason to get this. The only downside i can think of is probably the price and the length of the game, it took me around 7 hours to get all the endings, so take that into account and maybe wait for a sale, other than that, I have no complaints and can only wish for more from the devs in the future. Give it a try, trust me, you wont regret it",

        "text": "Im not very satisfied with most of the Not Recommended reviews Ive been seeing, so I want to make a definitive one that gives everyone a very clear idea of what this game has in it without spoiling the new content. I want to speak on what the nature of the new content is instead. Just honest thoughts about if its truly worth it. TLDR at the bottom.  If you havent played the Stanley Parable before, I wholeheartedly recommend buying this game, this version. Its a masterpiece.Wait, whaaaaat? I hear you say, Why is the review Not Recommended if you call it a masterpiece? Well if youre like me and already played the original, then you dont get too much out of this new version, even though you DO get a lot more content. I dont believe the store page gives new and returning players an honest idea of what this version adds. Not calling the devs intentionally deceptive here, but maybe too concerned with being secretive and vague about the new content that it misrepresents what it is. So what IS Ultra Deluxe anyways? What does it mean? This game is the original standalone game fully recreated in Unity. 99 of the original content is still here. What is gone? This is no longer in the Source engine, so most easter eggs and endings related to the dev console are gone. The game has been substantially visually upgraded in my opinion. It also has some nice QOL settings for those with visual impairment.So thats the base of the game that old players will be familiar with and likely not want to replay much, but what was added on top of it?  WHATS NEW? About 2-6 new hours of content depending on how much you will realistically do. There are about 3 new endings incorporated into the old branching paths. If you think of all the old endings like a flow chart, theres 3 new ends added into the flow chart. Near the start of the game, there is also a new door leading to a whole new big branch of content. Everything on this big new branch of the flowchart is new content, separated from the original game. After you finish this big new branch, which is really more like a single, larger ending, a new modifier is added to the start of every run in the main office youre familiar with. This is where the bulk of the new content comes from. Lets treat it like the modifier is a button you can press at the start of each run. What does pressing this button do? It replaces the flowchart with an identically connected flow chart, but the punchlines at the end are all modified to be about the same topic. It allows you to play though all the original endings like usual, but now all of them have new dialogue and some new environments that make the ending about the fact that you pushed the button at the start of the run and how much you love that button. Thats it. In essence, they have doubled the number of endings by simply repeating all the original endings but by making them all about the same joke. It wears thin after about 4 of these new endings. Some are, of course, more interesting than others, but it feels kind of lame to call it a new ending when all that changed is, at the end of a run, the narrator mentions oh by the way you pressed that modifier button! you sure love that button! Its unfortunate to me, because that clearly takes a lot of writing, voice work, and development time that really just does NOT pay off imho. Its not like they were lazy and didnt put the work in, but what they invested that time and energy into is only entertaining for a very brief time and doesnt really make you want to see all of it.So TLDR, its the base game with some visual upgrades and QOL with only minor easter eggs removed. What was added was 1 big new ending, 3-4 smaller new endings that gel in with the original ones, and like 20 new endings that are actually just modified versions of the old ones.No longer the TLDR. Further elaboration Make no mistake, many of the jokes in the big new ending got loud, audible laughs from me. There are many, genuinely good bits of storytelling in there as well. 2 of the 3-4 new smaller endings were also, by my own personal rating, very good. Theres some great new stuff in here, but thats just it. Theres SOME great new stuff. The rest of the new stuff is honestly just meh. Im glad to have bought the game and supported the devs. If you want to support the devs of a thing you like and get some new content out of it, buying this version is worth it, like buying a T-shirt as part of a charity drive. If thats something you want to do as a returning player, then yeah I say buy the game. If youre a new player bringing your fresh, unsullied mind to this game, then yeah, buy this game. But if youre a returning player who was interested in this game because you thought it was a kind of continuation of the original game, I honestly say youre better off just watching the new parts on youtube.So yeah, its a masterpiece, but I dont Recommend it for the vast majority of people who would be interested in it.The End. -Fin-. Adios.Edit nvm i think the game is worth it for returning players now because some comments said i was a poopy head. i hadnt thought about it like that before. glad we got that sorted out. Stanley opened the Steam review, he pressed the button with a thumbs up that said YesThis was not the correct button and he knew it perfectly well. Perhaps he wanted to enlighten the users looking at the negative reviews that the game is incredible and has not even minor issues. Games like this are the reason why I wish Steam had an option for Mixed reviews, instead of forcing you to pick between either a thumbs up or a thumbs down.Because while I do think TSP Ultra Deluxe has a fair deal of good moments and clearly had a lot of effort put into it, I also think that ultimately, all this new content comes across as pointless and derivative, resulting in a game that feels bloated and unsure of what its supposed to be doing, compared to the simplicity of the original release. The fact that I cant tell whether this is supposed to be the point or not makes this feeling all the more apparent.TSP Ultra Deluxe is basically the original game, with new content tacked onto it and with some graphical enhancements here and there mostly better lighting in a few places. I think a major point of disappointment for me is the fact that, while the game does have quite a few new ENDINGS, it has very few new PATHS. I counted I think 4 new paths one of which Im not sure if its bugged or supposed to be so... nonexistent, everything else is reusing the existing paths, all centered around the gag of the same thing, BUT NOW WITH A BUCKET!!!. This is not at all what I expected when the trailers claimed to have new endings. I expected those new endings to come from new paths cleverly snuck into the existing environment of the game like the aforementioned four, not... this.Considering the elaborate joke of the NEW CONTENT ending, I cant help but wonder if this is supposed to be intentional. A riff on how all those remakes and remasters lately are very pointless and either add very little or add stuff that dilutes the original experience. But, well, even if that was the intention, TSP Ultra Deluxe still commits that very mistake its supposedly mocking, it just does so ironically. If I smash my head with a hammer and say Im doing it ironically, it doesnt change the fact that Im smashing my head with a hammer, now does it?This is basically what TSP Ultra Deluxe comes across to me. A supposed parody that doesnt really know what its trying to do, and feels bloated and unfocused as a result. And while I admit the game gave me a good 6 hours of looking around and curiously checking out the new content, in the end it left me feeling confused and disappointed. And that feeling is why Im ultimately leaning more towards a thumbs down, since thats probably not a good feeling to have. The Stanley Parable is a great game. The 2013 version was cleverly-designed and its one of those games that has a bunch of easter eggs and mysteries if you dig into it, which Im a big fan of. A remaster with new endings sounded like itd be a nice romp. And I had high hopes, especially given the fact it was delayed by three whole years and the price point is as high as it is, and its so different that the original version is still being sold separately at full price.Now, as you surely see, Ive left a negative review on this release of the game. I still recommend playing the ORIGINAL version. You can skip to the conclusion for a short summary, if you havent played the original version of the game. If you have played it though, and are trying to decide whether this version is worth it or not, I do elaborate in the rest of the review. I might be a bit rambly, but I think I get my points across fairly well, at least.So what happened? Why dont I think it delivered? Well, theres a couple things at play here, in my opinion.The New ContentSo, first off, the main selling point was the additional content new to this version of the game. And it absolutely fails in nearly every way, I think. Almost all the new content is locked behind a door that says NEW CONTENT on it, which appears after you finish a certain number of endings based on whether you say youve played the original or not when the game first boots up.Yep. Theres only maybe three very small endings that were actually integrated into main game, and theyre all gag endings like we didnt fix this out-of-bounds glitch from the original game and instead added some narration to it!!!The bulk of the new content is just a single ending long, across several restarts, but still one ending. And the main plot point of this ending is this is the content that was added in Ultra Deluxe. I expected some of that, but not almost all the new content being about it. Its just one big joke about how game developers remaster games and dont add any substantial content. Its like the writers forgot that the original game wasnt JUST the fourth wall breaks. It explores other themes too. The only times this version does anything like that is by introducing story points that are a direct result of the self-referential humour.And then after this ending, youre given an item that you can choose to pick up at the beginning of the game every time you restart, which will change all the main games endings to reference the fact youre carrying this item around. But its almost never substantial. Its still the old routes, and only the very end of each one is changed in any meaningful way. Its a great gag, until you realise that literally all of the rest of the content revolves around it.Some of the endings didnt even get a whole new version with this item, because theyd be too much work to come up with a new version with that item. So some of the longest endings in the game, including one whole path that splits off into multiple other endings, are blocked off and you get a short unmemorable ending in those places instead. And they didnt even bother to change a couple endings at all. Plus, picking up the item screws with progression sometimes in a this is not how the game is intended to work sort of way. Was clearly just shoved on top of the core game to artificially inflate the amount of content, because they didnt truly have enough content to justify selling the game again.So, yeah, the content is the worst offender here. But thats only half the story here.Changes to the Core GameSo, besides that NEW CONTENT door and a couple of tiny gag endings sprinkled in, the original game is mostly in-tact. Heres the deal, though. In order to bring the game to consoles, and perhaps because developing for an extremely-outdated engine with obnoxious tools is becoming less and less enticing of an option, the developers opted to port the entire game from Valves Source engine to Unity.Now, Im a game developer myself. I dont like Unity, but it can work for some developers, and I think it could have worked out here. The problem is... its a pretty sloppy port. For a game that added an entire ending joking about an out-of-bounds bug they didnt catch, theyve sure added a lot more that werent there before. Movement is definitely a bit more slippery than it was originally, and climbing on things feels really finnicky compared to the original.Also, I have an ultrawide display, and some HUD elements didnt pop up for me unless I switched to 169, which made certain parts unplayable.But really, the biggest issue with this Source-Unity port, is the fact that it resulted in some content being cut. The original version takes advantage of the Source engines built-in command line. Theres cheat codes and even an ending accessed through console commands. Ultra Deluxe relocates at least one, maybe two of these cheat codes to some secret places around the game.But the ending very much relied on trying to enable cheats through the console, and it has been entirely cut from Ultra Deluxe. And that is ridiculous. Theres no technical reason there couldnt have been a simple reimplementation of the console command window made specifically for these couple cheats and the ending. None whatsoever. Even on consoles just pop-up the on-screen keyboard so you can type into it.There was another content change, possibly half a game engine thing, half licensing. One ending from the original has you exploring Minecraft and Portal. These were replaced with Firewatch and Rocket League. I suspect the latter of the two originals was replaced because it originally ran on the Source engine, so it easy to get exact. Since this Unity version was tailored specifically to The Stanley Parable, theyd have to do some fiddling to get it to feel exactly right... although theres a problem with that theory - same goes for Rocket League and really to an extent, Minecraft, neither of which feel quite right anyway. The first of the two originals I think was replaced because of licensing. Or maybe just, one was replaced for the sake of replacing both of the games when one of them had to be changed, I dont know.In any case, the new ones are worse. The pacing is real bad and one of them is stretched for far too long and the other is too short. And youre piped back into where you were taken in the original game in a pretty unnatural way. And Rocket League in particular is boring.Point is, wherever in the core game the original version and Ultra Deluxe differ, the original is better.ConclusionSo, honestly, considering that the new content doesnt really know what its doing and mainly just waters down the experience, and everything else thats been changed has been made worse... I actually think I have an unpopular opinion even among others that dont like this version of the game. Play the original. Ignore Ultra Deluxe entirely. I think it just adds bloaty content and waters down existing parts of the game. You will have a better experience with the 2013 release than with this one, even if youre missing some extra content. And especially after factoring in the price difference, its a no-brainer, I think.httpsstore.steampowered.comapp221910TheStanleyParableI really did want to like this, but I was just very underwhelmed and disappointed in the end. Oh well. Absolutely do recommend the original version though! Go play that if you havent! I love The Stanley Parable, but waiting 9 years and paying 25 for a version with only 2-3 hours of new content a lot of which is only slightly altered endings from the original does not sit well with me. I honestly expected after so much time in development and with the price tag discrepancy that this would be a Frog Fractions-esque surprise game that was something completely new.TLDR If you own the original, theres simply not enough new content to justify the 25 price tag. I only give this a not recommended aiming towards people who played through the original.  The Ultra Deluxe version is just a rehash of the same game with a few added endings and maybe an hours worth of new content.  Its not worth repurchasing the game at full price to see them - just head over to YouTube.  If its your first time playing, then this version is worth it.To its credit though, the devs fully admit to this themselves within the game itself, so theres that at least. I loved the original Stanley Parable back in the day, and I was looking forward to this expanded version for a long time. However, I can only recommend it at full price to people who have not played the original. For those who have played the original, I dont recommend it unless you buy it at a discount.To be clear, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe has a lot of new content. It essentially doubles the number of endings the original game had, but almost all of those new endings feel really derivative, because they literally follow the same paths you used to get the endings in the original game. Seriously 90 of the new endings are obtained by following the same steps you followed for the old ones, except with an added step at the beginning of each run. However, even some of the truly new endings dont feel super unique either. There are a few extended new content-related endings that poke a lot of fun at superfluous  unnecessary sequels, and they really just fall into the same problems that those sequels actually have. This might be an intentional design choice, but it doesnt make for a terribly satisfying or fun experience to someone who was hoping for more story paths and variety in this expanded re-imagining.Again, for people new to The Stanley Parable, this is 100 worth the price I just think 24.99 is steep for someone whos already experienced most of what this game has to offer. When Stanley opened the Steam review, he pressed the button with a thumbs up that said YesThis was not the correct button and he knew it perfectly well. Perhaps he wanted to enlighten the users looking at the negative reviews that the game is incredible and has not even minor issues. It would be nice if there was a neutral option.I wanted to like and recommend it But as someone who played the previous version, this is just practically the same thing but with more stuff slapped on it. It would fit more as a DLC rather than a standalone version.But in short If you HAVENT played Stanley Parable at all. This game is worth the full price. Go buy it now!However if you HAVE played Stanley Parable before, its just better to wait for sale. Like I said, this is basically just the Stanley Parable, but with additional endings. However to get to the new stuff you will have to go through the older endings first, and that can get tedious if you have played the OG Stanley Parable already. Fortunately, the game asks you if you played the Stanley Parable before and will let you access the new content sooner. Unfortunately you will still need to do some of the old endings first.And the new content is... hit or miss. Some of the early scenes had me laughing the whole way But the latter endings left me feeling nothing, or actually bored me out. To me it felt like the devs had a quota to fill, but ran out of ideas mid-development. Honestly, as someone who played and loved the original, This review was on point. Overwhelmingly Positive is for those who havent played it yet.Back when this was announced at The Game Awards in 2018, I was hyped.The game experienced a lot of delays since then, but recently it finally released in 2022.And I am severely disappointed.The original game is almost unchanged besides graphical tweaks and new effects here and there.The original game now has two new endings and one that has been changed, presumably for copyright reasons.I assume the door that leads to the actual new content unlocks after doing some of the original endings.And this is where it goes downhill. The game tries to be self-aware and ironic about itself, jokes about it being a expansion or even jokes about a sequel!But heres the thing Thats the only gag. That the game got new content. It grows stale after a while, and are probably more true to the actual experience than the writers might have intended.The new content of Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is lacking, and it doesnt help that the game was joking about it early in the path of the new content.After going through some areas that cant be accessed again until completing the game, the narrator makes some tweaks to the original game and we are send to Stanley Parable 2!Except its just the regular office with some balloons and figurines you can find here and there. But what about the new endings? As already mentioned, there are two new endings to the main route of the game. After being send back to the office in Stanley Parable 2, you will see a bucket on a pedestal on your way through.And thats how you get the new endings. You pick up this bucket, and go about the original games endings with almost the exact same condition. Every mian game ending has a bucket-variant, except for two, which in turn have been replaced with one bucket centered one.Yes, the glorious new endings revolve around a  bucket. It was funny at first, Ill admit, but it grew stale after the second Bucket-ending.But at least the whole Stanley Parable being recreated is correct, right? Well, yes and no. Its complicatedAs also mentioned before, the original game is barely changed. It doesnt look any better than it did in my memory. But it was recreated In Unity, which might explain the fact this is a standalone title and it took so long to come out.Wait, standalone title? Thats right!For the cheap price of 21,99 10 more than the original or the bargain price of... 14,66, if you already own the original game.What?The majority of this game is just the original game from 2013, except you have to rebuy it  increased price if you already  owned it.This shouldve been either a free update or a 5 to 10 DLC for the original title, not this lackluster 15 bucks expansion pack.ConclusionBuy the original. A large part of it is identical to the fancy new Ultra Deluxe version, and it sure is a whole lot cheaper and more worth the price.If you already own the original, dont buy it either. Pass it up. If you really wanna experience Stanley Parable again, just download the OG-version and play that. - MissCassidy tldr too short for too much dosh, get on sale only.almost no new choices, just 90 bucket dialogue bloat. prologue is good but the game quickly sours, probably since its meta commentary but it doesnt matter because its still boring either waywhile the original stanley parable was more of a commentary on predeterminism and ludonarrative dissonance, ultra deluxe does away with a single focal theme and allows itself to explore further into the reaches of odd and strange territory. apart from what i can call the prologue of the new content which is mostly about the state of industry on video game expansions, criticism received from both professional journalistic sources and the average player in relation to the product, and the disillusioning effect of nostalgic self indulgement.what ultra deluxe really is, however, is a few new setpieces to walk throughgawk at, about four to five hours worth of strutting around in the same corridors from the first game listening to maybe an hour of new dialogue and extra content sprinkled throughout the pre-existing game of the stanley parable. i suppose the prologue lampshades this quite hard but that doesnt really mean i enjoyed walking through what was basically the same game just because the game poked fun at itself. except now with a bucket in my hand, listening to ol kevvo try to bend circumstances im already familiar with into something weird, zany and not at all fitting this is often a hit or miss.by lacking a focal theme and instead just seperating these pre-existing choices into multiple, completely unrelated ones with the glaring exception of a bucket present ultra deluxe really does feel like just a lot of cheap bucket gags thrown together for the sake of it. sometimes theyre funny, but often theyre not and i wonder why i just repeated the same thing i did years ago to hear the narrator say something kind of new and almost always bucket related usually not insightfulhumorouswhatever.maybe my expectations were too high for this expansion. but i only expected the definition of the word, an expansion to the core principle of the stanley parable, which is different choices leading to different paths. i just didnt anticipate that these paths would just end up being reused, meaning barely any new choices to make, and the only differences are the outcomes. maybe that elevator in the room adjacent to the bosses office would have served some purpose. theres an idea. ultra deluxe isnt a terrible expansion by any means. it starts off quite nicely with the prologue and the skip button, valid and thought provoking commentaries about criticism. and then it quickly falls off to bucket gags and retreading old ground way too often. i really dont think its worth the current price which is why im not recommending it and i got a 33 discount. the prologue is quite enjoyable for a while, but it quickly loses charm as you realize that youre just in the same place again, doing the same things, and sometimes you watch something marginally different than what you used to remember happen.if ultra deluxe was specifically designed to highlight the dangers of the themes established in the prologue, and then make us as players actually live through them not just from an ingame perspective but also as the followers of a widely anticipated product never living up to the standards that we beset it showing us that nostalgic value can only ever be lived in its fullest through the memories of an individual and never actually played into practice i.e. ultra deluxe itself and its repeated levels telling us look ultra deluxe is just stanley parable but with reused levels, bucket jokes and collectables, this is what people are doing nowadays then i guess i got the memo.that doesnt change the fact that its still underwhelming and that i PAID ACTUAL MONEY for something that wasnt worth the amount i paid, even if it was intentionally designed that way.also to prove im not mercilessly slamming this game just because i hate everything, here are some things i liked about the game the prologue, reading scathing steam reviews, skip button sequence, IM DONEY WITH THE FUNNY, the collectable video, setting the system clock on boot. none of these come even close to making up for its setbacks though The original Stanley Parable cost 10 on release. This costs twice that. You might think that the 33 discount offered to owners of the original would mean more than double the content has been added, but this is simply not the case.In brief,  most of the new content uses a new bucket item as a sort of key in order to access it. This does not last long until you have exhausted all of the endings that were in the original game. The new content lasts about 5 hours. howlongtobeat.com records the average completionist playtime of the original as 7.5 hours. The discount for original owners of the game does not reflect the actual amount of new content that has been added - again, you have to wonder why people are being asked to pay double the cost of the original.This is far worse for people that experienced the first game without having purchased it, either through a friend or by watching a playthrough. Why should you pay double the price of the original for less than double the amount of content? The content itself does not elevate itself far enough to justify this.Pick it up for cheaper. If you have experienced the original but lack access to the discount, buy Outer Wilds or something instead. If you have never experienced the game, go for it, but I still think this should cost 15 as a base value, not 20. I get the appeal for this game for people, I think. I might be wrong considering people like this game for different reasons. Which is okay.The games all about making choices, The games centered about making choices. but theyre mostly making only obvious choices. I thought because this games centered about choices, itd feel personal or something. Like the little things you do affect the bigger story, or the concept of butterfly effect or karma would be used in the game, But no, not really. I played this completely blind because I didnt play the OG stanley parable. And when I explored things that doesnt feel obvious to explore, it never really rewards you with anything. And because I played the game completely blind, because I didnt know what the game is all about other than making choices, I didnt know what I was supposed to do. I guess its because in video games nowdays, theres a lot of choices that you can obey or disobey. People like disobeying things so the games all centered about that concept. But when I played the game this game, I felt like the obeying orders and disobeying orders thing FEELS like obeying orders. Both of them. Because the game is about choices and basically tells you to do BOTH the obeying order and the disobeying order. Making me feel like i had to double disobey it by exploring places around the room or something because I thought thered be a secret in other play that the game might take notice.Which is why I ended up always trying to interact with objects like turning all pcs off or interacting with this and that and so far the only thing ive ever achieved, and the only thing that has rewarded to me this was the door achievement. It was an achievement Ive gotten on my very first run of the game. And even though the achievement itself is meant to be a funny easter egg for people, because I have an unclear way of playing the game, I thought the game would be littered with THAT kind of easter eggs in other places, only to discover the fact that, no, so far, Ive only encountered the door and the keypad if you enter quick enough before the narrator tells you the keypads number code as the only really choices that feel invisible or personalized. Meaning Ive spent more hours actually just exploring for nothing than the obvious things to do, actually progressing.Anyways, its just a personal experience of this game. I didnt like it because it was bad, Its just I played it wrong, wasted hours for nothing and i meant wandering around lots of rooms for a lot of times trying to find something to end up finding nothing, and not how you reset every ending, and now Im too burnt out and demotivate it to continue it. If youre a blind player, and you have the same mindset of wanting to explore or something, maybe this would helpJust a note for here though. Button path, hands down, favorite path. Its probably the only path that really made me think deeply about life in this game. The Stanley Parable was a story about control, disobedience, and the complex relationship between Stanley and the Narrator. It was a story about chaos and paths, illusion, social pressure and of how a game can play the player. In other words, unique and brilliant.This isnt. Dont have high hopes, its a good addition, but it cant live up expectations. It feels like a rant the developers threw on unsatisfied fans which Im not, I loved the first game. Its a story about marketing fluff and nonsense, which is nice in its own way, but it doesnt leave you as much as the first. Oh, why cant I jump - added the jump circle. The narrator talks too much - now he talks even more. Can I skip it? - add an ending with that. The bucket is barely interesting, scratching the provoking examples in the original game. Its also an idea borrowed from the companion cube in Portal, nothing incredibly original.It fits the game in a sense, but if we want to take things to this level, then Im very selfish, and Im writing a negative comment so it can be featured in The Next Stanley Parable. My pleasure, Crows.I wouldnt recommend this to somebody who owns the original game. This game uses false advertising, but it does it for the purpose of making an artistic commentary on the nature of false advertising. Its up to you to decide if this commentary is worth the asking price. I however, do not think so myself, and Im quite upset with how much money this product asks for while purposely failing to deliver upon the expectations it purposefully built up. If you own the original Stanley Parable on PC, this product is absolutely not worth the asking price unless its considerably marked down in a future sale. If youre a newcomer, then if youre looking to save money, the original is a perfectly fine alternative, but you might as well enjoy the extra content in this if you have the cash to spare. If youre looking to buy this for consoles, then I think its worth the money, especially on switch where there is the appeal of portability and showing the game to other people, or as a party activity.First of all, the elephant in the room, the reviews are Very Positive, yet most of them are a single word, Bucket, or a copypasta that the game instructs you to spam in the reviews. I thought this was funny at first, but now its creepy. I feel like people are going to look at Very Positive and trust that all those positive reviews have an actual positive opinion instead of farming steam points with a copy paste. But in all fairness, thats Steams problem. Steam should ask you if your review is a joke and not display your answer publicly, as to not ruin the comedy, but Steam should not count your review towards the overall total on the graph and average rating. Im just saying, you should keep that in mind.The majority of non-copypasta positive reviews commend this game for providing unique commentary on lazy cash grab sequels and re-releases in the modern video game industry. And it does a really good job of that, but these reviewers, and the developers of this release, fail to respect the fact that you, the consumer, are expected to spend 25 USD on this bait and switch commentary. The things said about this game by developers, such as calling this a re-imagining or more than double the endings are purposefully misleading marketing. And Im not going to give that a pass and not warn you about it because its somehow artistic false advertising.I wont be going into major spoilers, but honestly, the bucket is not a spoiler. Theres no substance to it and its the majority of the new content. My biggest issue with the bucket is that this game, completely misunderstands what the original Stanley Parable Half-LIfe 2 mod, and its 2013 Remake, even are. The Stanley Parable was not a juvenile joke. Its many endings and paths showed many emotions, some of them were for comedy, and they were quite good comedy, such as the adventure line path, the baby, and so on. But others would intend to give you different emotions, such as hope, sadness, stress, and even horror. Now, all of those emotions have been replaced by haha bucket funny if you choose to see the new versions of most of these endings.Should you choose to explore the games new content. Youll find out that while the original games had very diverse endings, this game has mostly bucket funny endings.And Im gonna say it. The bucket is not funny. Not in my opinion. There is no joke. No set up, no punch line. Its what you might call XD Randem humor. I actually did laugh at its inclusion... The first time, and only the first time. I honestly feel as though the Narrators amazing voice acting was wasted so much on it. If you believe that the word bucket over and over again is the funniest thing ever, then I suppose you can disregard my review and buy the game right now and enjoy.However, a small amount of the new content, such as the skip area managed to impress me with the kind of experience I was hoping for in a new release in the Stanley Parable series, but even including the bucket content, the new additions to the game such as this skip area are extremely few and far between. The game is openly self aware about the lack of new content, and jokes about it. The problem is that the joke isnt a joke just making fun of the games industry, it ends up making fun of you because you paid for the game because you saw the reviews said Play the game blind dont research it! if you believed the hype that was built up over the last 3 years of delays for this product and spent up to 25 USD on it, then you might just find out that the punchline youre searching for is your new account balance.Seeing the discourse over this game in the reviews be centered around claims like subverting expectations here reminds me a lot of The Last Jedi, if you remember the massive disagreement that movie created.But lets get back to you, the reader who is considering if this game is worth your money, youre probably asking right now Whats this Bucket about?The Bucket is symbolism for empty promises. When you choose to pick up the bucket, the game purposefully ruins the original games endings to make them worse and kill the original tone they had. This is commentary on bad sequels which do the same thing, yet this game is still asking for a lot more money than the 2013 remake, which actually DID deliver on adding a lot of new content and endings to the original Half-Life 2 mod, as well as a complete visual overhaul and unique art style separate from Half-Life 2s. That was well worth the asking price, even though the original mod was available for free. Ultra Deluxe asks for even more money than the original 2013 remake did, even at the discounted price that was in place for a small amount of time, and proceeds to hold back on giving you a comparable amount of new content. Instead, it laughs at you if you were expecting that content after paying.In conclusion, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is a breakdown of what it feels like to be a developer working on a follow up to a beloved classic. Yet, its up to you if this meta experience about the developers feelings is worth the money or if you were hoping for something more in line with the original game and the new content added in its remake. I feel terribly sorry to give the game a thumb down. This game might be the most meaningful game in the past years, but I do feel that the game is teaching me not to do as the narrator said. In the new content, the producer showed his concern in negative reviews and gave a lot of comment on it to make me give this game a positive review? but Ill give it a negative review instead as a part of the game. In conclusion, you cant miss the game. Its a masterpiece. I did in fact really like the new content, and wish there was a neutral review option. For this review, I am judging the dlc alone, and not the content in the base game - visuals are remastered but it doesnt really make much of a difference. I really enjoyed my time with the new dlc, but by the time I finished I was just left thinking - thats it? It felt very hollow which i know you could say was kind of the games intention but didnt feel right. It feels like the game suddenly halts to a stop abruptly out of the blue. Not to mention SPOILERS AHEAD that almost 80 of the new content is actually the same endings as the base game but with slight variations when you hold the bucket. 80 of the dlc is genuinely a continuous gag about the bucket, which isnt necessarily bad, but it leaves something to be desired. It was less about satire about video games than it was about the gag about the bucket, which is just sad to me in general. I was just looking for something more The original game is plenty of fun because the hidden goal is to break the game in many ways and discover this clever game has anticipated yours mischiefs. In The Ultra Deluxe the game look like it put constantly a collar and a leash on you at the point its only a walking simulator. There were so many situations where i was trapped with only no choice but the one choice the game want you to do... and these situations are not only too many, they are way too long too.But seriously, its a buy if you never play this game or buy in on sale. The only reason for my thumb down is because i want to see if this bad review will be show in The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe 2 DLC with new bucket skins. Too expensive for what was basically Stanley Parable BUCKET DLC!  3-4 new original endings.Dont get me wrong i liked the new stuff, but when it takes so long to make a game you just kinda expect more than this. Loved the skip forward ending though, wish more of the game was like that.The title definitely fits though. It sounds just like what Ubisoft would do with one of their games. Good one haha, right?Well when the joke needs 22, 5 hours and a moderate level of hype for the setup only for the delivery to be get pooped on it kinda makes you wanna go poop on it as well.I guess I was the stupid one, what did i expect from a game titled The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe?Im never touching buckets again in my life. I was disappointed the broom closet wasnt centre stage as the main character, the broom closet ending was my favorite xD i spent 3 years waiting for the stanely parable 2, at least the devs made it run on a potato.",
        "summary": "Ultra Deluxe is the original standalone game fully recreated in Unity. 99 of the original content is still here. There are about 3 new endings incorporated into the old branching paths. The game has been substantially visually upgraded in my opinion. It also has some nice QOL settings for those with visual impairment."

The highs, the lows, the victory, the defeat. But Undertale did something that no other game has ever done for me it made me feel like my actions actually mattered. Ive never been forced to think so much about my choices in a game. Do I spare this monster? Do I show them kindness, even if its just a few words? Or do I give in to my darker impulses and kill them? The fact that the game forces you to live with those choices, that no matter what path you take, the consequences hit home its just something that so many other games miss. Most games dont ask you to actually feel the impact of your actions. Undertale does. And thats what makes it stand out.Its not trying to WOOOW you with high-end graphics or flashy cutscenes. Hell, the visuals are super basic, the characters are pixelated, but it doesnt need all that. The real strength of this game lies in how it uses the medium of video games to tell its story. Youre not just a passive observer. Youre the one pulling the strings. The characters arent just there to look pretty or be generic NPCs  they have personalities, desires, fears, and they react to you. The whole game feels like its speaking directly to you, and thats a rare thing to find in modern gaming.The humor, the heartache, the twists  its all woven together so perfectly that I was laughing one moment and then tearing up the next. Undertale knows how to balance its tones, something a lot of games cant pull off. Its not just about having a good story  its about how the story makes you feel, and Undertale nails that in a way that very few games do.And the best part? You dont need to play this game with any kind of guide or prior knowledge. Just dive in and let it take you wherever it wants to go. Every playthrough is different, and no matter how you approach it  pacifist, neutral, genocide  theres something valuable to learn, something profound to experience. Its not just a game. Its an experience that stays with you long after youve turned off the console.If youve somehow never played this game, do yourself a favor. Play it. Go in blind, with no expectations other than to see what unfolds. I promise you, this is a game thats going to leave a mark on you. Its the kind of game that makes you think about what it means to be human, to have choices, to live with the consequences. A true masterpiece in every sense. 1010, and I wouldnt change a thing. Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.But... wow. Undertale blew me away. It doesnt need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the games name. And Im glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr god help us and the entire storys already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game wont be as incredible of an experience. Im sorry.Of course, I call Undertale an experience, not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it. Following the motto on the store page, the game where you dont have to destroy anyone, the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to Spare them!. And of course, you answer with Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? Whats in it for me? And thats where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the games selling point. And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here.Undertales ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your games startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the games story pathing. If youre the type who immerses yourself into the games charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that youre shaking in your seat in true fear and cant stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesnt stop being good from there onwards.On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the games sparing choice since youre too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isnt just a simple moment of Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, lets reset the game and nothing changes... the weight of a dark choice is huge. Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isnt explained to you, nothing. Theres very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... Its trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.Its as if youre doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And thats what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that youre willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. Its a test of your willpower, and its your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyones happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. Thats absolutely brutal, and yet thats still a choice. Amazing.Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyones been talking about this game, give it a shot. Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.It is a sin to call Undertale a game. Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free kill-em-all genres that a lot of games are falling into now.Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience. I hated Undertale.It was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.Then my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. I played Undertale. Its not a game about sexy skeletons. Its a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. Its a game about pushing the limits. Its a game about experiences, about what would happen if I did this?, about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldnt be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.Also, the skeletons arent even sexy.My advice to you Go in as blind as you can. Dont read walkthroughs. Dont watch playthroughs. Dont prepare yourself. Dont even look at overviews. Hell, dont even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game and give some well-earned money to a little white dog, and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Dont let anyone backseat. Dont listen to people who tell you theres a right way to play.And when you think youve reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?So, yes. I hated Undertale.And then I played it. This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless. Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games. And you begin to start ask Why?... Like Why should we play games?, Why are games different from other media?, Why should you use games as a form of expression? and even Why even play games at all?! Undertale come along and says, This is why. ---Gameplay---Try not to get addictedVery goodGoodNothing specialEhhBadJust dont ---Graphics---MasterpieceBeautifulGoodDecentWill doBadAwfulPaint.exe---Audio---FascinatingVery goodGoodDecentNot too badBadEarrape---Audience---KidsTeensAdultsEveryone---PC Requirements---Check if you can run paintPotatoDecentFastRich boiAsk NASA if they have a spare computer---Story---Doesnt haveSomething isnt nothing I guessNot greatly toldAverageGoodLovelyWill make you cry or smile alot---Playstyle---Almost never the same in any two peopleVaries a little bit from person to personWeapon AND character classesWeapon OR character classesCreative AND SurvivalCreative OR SurvivalMelee AND RangedMelee OR Ranged---Difficulity---Just press a bunch of buttonsEasySignificant brain usageEasy to learn  Hard to masterNot so easyDifficultDark Souls---Grind---NothingOnly if you care about leaderboardsranksIsnt necessary to progressA bit grindy sometimesAverage grind levelA bit grindyInsanity---Game Time---Long enough for a cup of teaShortAverageLongDepends on youEndless---Price---Just buy itWorth the priceWait for saleMaybe if you have some spare money leftNot recommendedDont throw money into a rubbish binFree---Micro-Transactions---EAMobile GameNecessary if you dont want to wait 15 weeks to construct a toasterPremium Currency AND Normal CurrencyPremium Currency OR Normal CurrencyQuick way to advanceFortniteSkinsEmotesEtcOnly to show off big timeLevel DLCSoundtrack DLCNone---BugsGlitches---Never had anyMinor bugsglitchesFew bugsglitchesCan get annoyingRuining the gameThe game itself is a big terrarium for bugsglitches---?10---12345678910 When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. I was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. I normally play actionadventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because thats what I thought this game was. In reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing Ive seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly no pun indended sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I dont often see anymore. You are doing yourself a disservice if you dont try this game out. And I dont say that lightly. Storywriting 10Music 8Replay value 7Gameplay 6 for the actual fun of it, but Ill give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. 9.510 Undertale is a game that has gained a considerable reputation, and even if you havent played it, youve likely heard of it to some extent. While graphics and size are not the sole determinants of a games quality, at first glance, its hard to imagine how Undertale garnered so much praise with its seemingly simplistic graphics and simple gameplay. In reality, Undertale absolutely deserves all the praise it has received, and even now, many elements and its music continue to exude vitality in various other domains.The game incorporates elements from traditional RPGs and Manic shooters in its gameplay, but what makes Undertale truly outstanding is not its gameplay but rather its storytelling and music. In terms of the story, Undertale presents players with a genuinely moving yet unconventional narrative about family, friendship, trust, and betrayal, employing a natural and unpretentious narrative approach. The games interactivity is also remarkably high, allowing players to deeply experience the impact of their actions within the game and explore countless details to fully appreciate the games charm. The characterization of the main characters in the game is vivid and lively, effectively showcasing their glamour. As for the music, Undertales original and captivating soundtrack, combined with the games storyline, provides players with a profound dual impact on their emotions and auditory senses.No matter how exceptional a masterpiece may be, it is not exempt from criticism. However, in my view, this is not a games flaw. Since the games primary focus is almost entirely on crafting its narrative content, if youre not interested in most games stories or cannot derive any emotional resonance from them, Undertale may not be suitable for you. Similarly, the games systems are relatively intricate and complex, encompassing numerous puzzle-solving elements. Additionally, it deviates significantly from most typical RPG games, making the game much more challenging without guidance, and experiencing all the games content in its entirety may require many meticulous operations. Furthermore, any spoilers regarding the games plot can significantly undermine the gaming experience, putting players in a dilemma between relaxing walkthroughs and preserving the integrity of the experience. Certain routes in the game also pose considerable difficulty, rivaling that of hardcore Manic shooters, which may hinder all kinds of players from smoothly experiencing all of the games content.Undertale is an absolute must-play, worth experiencing for the majority of players. Please be careful not to get in touch with any game spoiler content, as it will greatly diminish the impact of the gaming experience. While it may require more time, it is undoubtedly worth it. If you dont enjoy narrative-driven games, dislike spending time exploring the games content on your own, and dont enjoy empathizing with the games characters, then Undertale may not be suitable for you. Buy this game. Go in blind. DO NOT SPOIL THE GAME. Its old but gold. This game is absolutely phenomenal. OK SO U SHOULD BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE THERE IS A DUCK TAT CARRIES YOU ACROSS A LITTLE RIVER OF WATER IT LIKE PICKS U UP AND FLIES U ACROSS This game actually made me feel bad.Going into the game I expect an neat little indie rpg.Did i get that? Yeah, but did i also get the emotional roller-coaster of a game? Definitely. Did I get the deep lore that makes up this game? Yes.Did I get the rich Character Development of the game? YesDid I get weird Lsd fever dream vibes from this game? yesAnd would I play it again? Yes. sans has taken over my life and is now my computer skeleton husband--- Graphics --- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it MS-DOS--- Gameplay --- Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Watch paint dry instead Just dont--- Audio --- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Im now deaf--- Audience --- Kids Teens Adults Grandma--- PC Requirements --- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer--- Game Size --- Floppy Disk Old Fashioned Workable Big Will eat 10 of your 1TB hard drive You will want an entire hard drive to hold it You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data--- Difficulty --- Just press W Easy Easy to learn  Hard to master Significant brain usage Difficult Dark Souls--- Grind --- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboardsranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding--- Story --- No Story Some lore Average Good Lovely Itll replace your life--- Game Time --- Long enough for a cup of coffee Short Average Long To infinity and beyond--- Price --- Its free!

Some games are okay.Some games make you stop and reevaluate who you are at the very core of your person, make you feel a depth of emotion that no work of art ever has before, and then leaves you with a genuine sense of loss when its all finally over and gone, because you know you wont ever be able to experience anything that beautiful for the first time ever again.You should probably play Undertale and find out which one it is. This game truly makes you consider what to do before you do it. It will make you laugh and cry. The characters are charming and funny. I have over 1000 hours total gameplay so I think its safe to say this game is amazing! Funni skeletons and some weird animals 1010 Flower bad Playing this game fills you withDetermination This game was and still is  amazing. I dont play pixel games often, but this game proves worthy of the highest tier.The storyline is very captivating, and you always have a desire to explore forwards. Characters are unique and lovable in their own ways, whether thats looks, personality, humour, or speech. Map design and environments are quite lovely. The story changes based on how you interact with people and battle opponents your choices   matter, but you can also replay with a different playstyle to experience a new game. The endings are especially brutal in the best way possible. Youll wish you could erase your memory and play it for the first time again.Even if I had an hour to think, I could not create  complaints for this game. I wish I could give it 2 thumbs up. You wont regret buying Undertale, simply put.",

        "text": "People will hate me for saying this, but it just isnt everyones cup of tea. You may really enjoy this game, but dont feel like you have to... My favorite game of all time, unfortunately i had unrestricted internet access and ruined my childhood Before you get out your pitchforks and prepare the tarfeathers, I have not given Undertale a Not recommended review because it is a bad game. I understand that many people thoroughly enjoy it, but I truly cannot recommend this game because I did not have fun playing it. It did not seem to impact me emotionally the way it seems to have impacted everyone else, and it just didnt appeal to me as a whole. Undertale has some amazing music if you enjoy that soundstyle, some cool game mechanics the mini games for avoiding attacks, some nice sentiments and lessons, and a couple interesting fourth wall breaking moments, but I still cant even close to say I enjoyed it.Hey, maybe itll appeal to you as I am obviously in the minority not recommending an overwhelmingly positive reviewed game, I just didnt have some epiphany-like moment with this game to become infatuated with it. game difficulty is inflated too much by the tiny little arrow keys on my laptop... wish I could change it to use WASD instead Let it be known that I am typing up this review immediately after finishing the True Pacifist run of Undertale, This game has left me with mixed feelings, swaying more on the negative side and definitely not living up to the hype and praise that the steam page would have you believe. I dont think its worth the 9.99 base price tag or 17.99 if you decide to buy the soundtrack with it. Im not very good at writing Steam reviews, but Ill just list the pros and cons.Pros of UNDERTALE  The soundtrack has some very nice tunes on it which help build atmosphere during some of the battles and areas of the game.   A handful of the enemies have unique looks and there are plenty of nice visuals in the game that are appealing to the eye.   The battle system is very unique and actually affects the outcomes and choices of the ending or how people in the game view you. You can FIGHT and you can give MERCY in almost every battle in the game.  The dialogue and writing in some spots makes you warm up to the characters. This games strength definitely lies within its writing and dialogue, with the gameplay taking a backseat.  This game does have a knack with the developer thinking of a lot of things, such as changes in the games code resulting in different things happening, savingreloading getting different dialog options, and plenty of other secrets.  The game has multiple endings with very different results.Cons of UNDERTALE I know this has been said numerous times before, but the humor in this game gets really dry and grinding at some points, and while that is the point of some of the characters in the game, this still doesnt take away from the humor putting one off or taking them out of the situation at hand. Theres a lot of puns and random humor that gets hammered in a lot, While this game does have plenty of similarities to Earthbound, Earthbounds humor is a lot more timeless due to the references it makes while this game also depends on a lot of internet memes that will be irrelevant or stale in a couple of years or months. You have to be absolutely involved with about 5-6 of the characters in this game, with some of them having the very lousy humor that I stated above. This might make you turn off from the game immediately or later into the game due to this because even I had a hard time feeling for these characters nearing the end of the game as they started popping out cheap one-liners, puns, or just general stuff that felt a little too wooden or off-base for their characters at the time.  The gameplay segments of the game consists of puzzles and minigames. The puzzles are rather easy and seem more like tacked-on roadblocks in the game in an attempt to give it more gameplay than being challenging. The only time I had trouble with a puzzle is when I may have accidentally walked past the solution or stepped on the wrong block. The battle segments are more in the vein of Warioware, The Impossible Game, or other flash games that require quick timing and jumps from segment to segment. An attack consists of hitting the sweet spot in the middle of the screen by timing it correctly, while a defense is usually a bullet hell or reflexes segment. This may not be hard for a couple of people, but it does get boring when it starts doing the same one or two bullet hell tricks over and over in a boss that may take 10 turns to pacify. This can also be frustrating when theres a specific sequence of actions you must do to pacify a monster, or when  the game intentionally has you attack the monster, which you have never done up to this point in a pacifist run, and spare it afterwards in battle or have it lead into a cutscene.   If you get the best ending in the game, theres basically no replay value after this point because the game has a sequence upon starting up afterwards that involves one of the characters in the game pleading you not to start the game over because the characters youve saved are enjoying their new lives in the ending youve created for the characters.  This explanation is very nice depending on how captivated you were by the game, but ultimately disappointing if you were expecting more on a second play through. Those who pursue a second playthrough may also be disappointed in what happens if they experiment, though... Your mileage may vary on how you feel about this. This game is inspired obviously by Earthbound and Mother 3, with this games creator actually having created his own Earthbound ROM hack. This is good and all, but at some points it tries VERY VERY hard at some points to be similar to Earthbound and Mother 3 in its areas and character behavior when it lacks the charm, characters to relate to, clever dialogue, and extended character development to live up to it. The scenes leading up to the end and the final bosses themselves really give off this vibe when compared to EB and M3. After playing this game, it really just wanted me to go back and play Earthbound or Mother 3 instead. These characters just didnt give me the same feelings that the MOTHER characters did. The games focuses a lot on the relationship between your human character and the monsters, but swerves a bit from side to side on what youre supposed to be focusing on in the story, especially when the true ending requires you to go through and complete whatever you may have missed that might actually be considered side stories in other games. Theres a handful of distractions in your journey that seem a bit unnecessary when your characters intended goal is to get back home with the human world.  A minor note is that the game does have a couple of mandatory scenes that have rapidly moving and flashing lights, one example involving a randomized puzzle that rapidly flashes between green, red, purple, orange, blue, yellow, and pink while shuffling the colors for the puzzle. There also may be some disturbing imagery in the game that is unavoidable when this game is being touted as a game for all ages.  Overview In all, at this price and with some specific issues with the game, I can not recommend it to everybody or even a large majority of Steam users. It lacks charm or visuals that lower-priced games or larger-scale games have and some people may feel like they were cheated out of their money and time. Maybe I was a little too bought in with the hype of this game being a massive Mother 3 and Earthbound fan, but I dont think its worthy of all the praise that its getting. Its a nice and cozy RPG that would do its job well at a lower price, but I dont think its fit to be considered a perfect game when theres not a lot of game play to it in the first place. If this goes on sale at a discount, Id recommend picking it up and trying it out to see if its worth your time. For now, I wouldnt recommend it. The time I put into this game could have definitely been of more benefit in playing Space Funeral, the MOTHER series, and plenty of others.Also, in an attempt to try and put this in the nicest way possible while failing to do so, I have to mention that the creator Toby Fox comes off as a bit pretentious from activity on social media. While I dont know him in real life and know that the 128 character limit or whatever Twitter has can not show a persons whole feelings... It seems hes very opposed to criticism, whether it be legitimate or less than legitimate. UNDERTALEs success has given him somewhat of a big head, but I hope it doesnt result in some breakdown or egotistical attitude that weve seen from other indie success stories. Edit Ive at this point done the two most polarized playthroughs and watched some runs of middle-ground ones, I havent really found anything in either that I feel changes things significantly enough to change the review content much past making this disclaimer.What kills me about Undertale is that its hard to review. Its hard to review here, its hard to review anywhere a numerical rating system is employed, to say nothing of a binary one. First and foremost, if there was an option to place this in a more gray area in terms of ratings, Id absolutely do so. Undertale has a lot of heart and effort put into it, but as of writing this theres at least three hundred people who here who couldve told you that. Ive followed this game since the demo and have all the love and respect in the world for devs like Toby and what they do. If anything, theyre role models who I dream of emulating one day and making my own work that can be so impactful. Hopefully, with that all said, Ive made my intent clear enough to lower the  pitchforks and torches long enough to plea my case here. Ive decided against trying to categorize anything here as good or bad, because the thing is that many features could be virtues or flaws depending on the individual. The BasicsThe ratio of dollars to hours is a little shaky, if thats a big selling point for you. I just narrowly broke even after doing a completionist run of assumedly the best ending.I experienced no crashes nor bugs, at worst I saw exactly one spelling error, which Im sure could be taken care of hastily, so in those terms, very professional quality standard overall. If you can help it, absolutely do NOT use a guide. Undertale is an experience, your first playthrough at least should be as fresh and genuine as you can make it. Figuring out what choices do and dont have this or that impact will greatly take away from a game designed to pick your brain and make you feel. If you played the demo and loved it, stop reading here, youre gonna love the full game unless youre an anhedonic husk like me.  Aesthetic Music averages out with a pretty damn good by my poor tastes. Some overworld themes were forgettable but overall Id say theres enough tracks to listen to over and over again to justify buying the soundtrack, theres more than enough standout songs here to keep it from a one-hit-wonder, though maybe given the team credentials this is no surprise. Sound choice is cute, charming, for the most part nothing overstays its welcome. Visuals are clean, even in a world of oddities as these you wont have much trouble working out what you see at any time. Though a few overworld maps get a bit dull and repetitive where this game absolutely shines is character sprites. Few other places will you find such a fine middle ground between simplicity and expressiveness.  Story and Gameplay   The main hook, a large feature of the game is that while youre free to savescum with your single file the game has a second, persistent ambiguous data cluster it saves and keeps track of behind your back. While the original demo touted this feature heavily it becomes a little played out now, especially since its used commonly to little effect, making the times it does matter far less surprising. Sometimes this means skipping cutscenes in cleverly written ways, though, so you could say it balances as a bunch of neutrals and a few positives. It has an un-game feature of sorts where it loves to bait you into following old instincts based on patterns and tropes in other games then pulling the rug out from under you. Its clever. At first. If there comes to be a point when you just get burnt out on opening snake-filled peanut cans then even when the bait-and-switch is unexpected youll be too far gone to care. You absolutely positively need to be invested in most to all of the recurring cast. Youre gonna see a lot of these guys, and if you find some or another element of their personality annoying youre gonna have a bat time, mate. This might be a clever metaphor for something since I had to pretend to care about a handful of monsters who had me gritting my teeth at their every appearance if I wanted to get the good ending. For me, this was a rather large hangup as the game will depend largely at your attachment to the characters. Unless youre coming in almost 100 blind youll be doing the most pacifist run you can. Unfortunately, this means just slightly less repetition than the violent route. Common enemies are almost always check actions menu, do the nice one, mercy next turn while bosses go do one or two simple actions and then just stall out for a dozen or so turns until the boss is done talking.  This can be a little problem when the best parts of a boss battle are the music and imagining my Gandhi-Madotsuki-Jaundice-Baby ducking and weaving through flurries of blows. Offsetting the attacking or lack thereof being bland it certainly makes up for it in the defending portions. A sprinkle of Dragon Quest flavor and some bullet hell mixed with really unique and appealing patterns made for some interesting conflicts, though the thrill was dampened by common enemies being a nusciance to clear out as fast as possible or boss battles dragging on and having you weave minute variations of the same attack. For a game that should know how deadset you are on not killing, it really doesnt do you any favors. Too many things result in items and equipment you wont much need. In total I bought one anti-weapon, found better armor and slowly came to realize I had no more item management to do other than the rare event of spending my not-fighting-money on healing items.  Overview A lot of people are gonna tell you Undertale is perfect, charming, touching, and I just wanted to say that I love what these devs do, but this game is some of those things, none of the other things and subjectively other things. I dont think my hu-man shell has the capacity for cynicism to say that the kickstarter cash investment and time taken didnt shell out nicely and fairly reflect Toby putting it to good use, but I also cant say that its without flaws, flaws that might ruin an experience for you even if you came in wanting to play it and love it. What I can say is that its the best kind of game for success. If youre already sold on it, you buy it. If youre unsure though, I cant say what kind of person would or wouldnt like it. I can only say you need to experience it yourself and Ill be damned if that isnt something special.Maybe as a whole I didnt like the full version, but I hope, pray, Ill be the narrowest of minorities on that.Undertale will give you a warm smile.Undertale will give you flowers. and you will cry. Reasons you may love  hate this game    Bullet hell gameplay   Bone puns and fart jokes   16-bit art style and chiptune soundtrack    6 hours of gameplay This game wasnt for me, and Im okay with that I guess that my disappointment was proportional to the expectations, and I wonder unsarcastically how can this game have such good reviews.The overall atmosphere, at first, may seem a bit silly, ok, but its tongue-in-cheek, so it has to be witty.Then, as I encountered new characters, talked to strangers, read signs, etc. the stress on this its not funny so its funny humour gets really annoying e.g. every time you save,  fills you with determination which may be amusing the 1st time, but hardly the 30th .Im not competent enough to criticize the game or the story as for themselves. My point is just that the author clowns to the point that it made me lose interest in both. I really dont see what all the fuss is about. This game isOK, I suppose. The writing is kind of funny and you could say the art style is endearingly retro, but the main premise of you dont have to kill people is not revolutionary at all, and the gameplay manages to be boringly repetitive while also constantly changing between underdeveloped mechanics. The soundtrack is, well, adequate, but theres nothing memorable or distinctive about it. If you play this game, you might have some fun, I guess, but there are a lot of far better games to waste your money on. Does the destination justify the journey?For me, no. I liked the story. I really did. But with that in mind, I really didnt enjoy the gameplay that delivered the story. Actually between the beginning and the ending, I didnt enjoy the story either. Lots of what happened was pretty hamfisted and the characters were written as kind of caricatures of base human emotions, like if you asked a child to rewrite Where The Wild Things Are. And the one character that calls you constantly after you meet them, and when theyre not doing that, interrupts your progress with unavoidable posts on the social media app they install on your phone without your say is just infuriating. With that being said though, wow, the combat. SO I dont like bullet hell. I get it. I dont like it. But typically it is a consistent game mechanic that you get chances to adapt to and you can learn patterns over time. This game employs short, maybe 15 second intervals of enemy specific randomized bullet hell as combat, and you have to just learn patterns over that short period, then try to determine what to do in between combat points, before it dumps you into another one of the bullet hell modes, which you may be hit before you recognize it. And by the time you have it all figured out, that boss is over and you likely will never see it again. And if you get used to certain mechanics, a new boss will come along and change the color of your heart and make you learn completely new mechanics for just their fight. It was completely frustrating, moreso from the fact that I really liked the story and wanted to see where it went, but had to endure restarting fights that I hated over and over again because they were in the way of my ability to enjoy the game. Youre taught that there are certain actions that will help you avoid conflict so you look to do that, but most of the bosses just require you to endure for a certain amount of time if you are to beat them without killing them. Now there is the option of just murdering everything. Im just not the type of player to embrace the bad ending so I didnt even try. If I was going to get through this game that I wasnt enjoying, I was going to get through it once, and I wanted the best outcome I could get from a single playthrough.The ending was fantastic. The story was mostly told then. You have to do SO many things to get the true ending, but the story it told was great, I just wish that some of it was sprinkled along the journey to make the actual playthrough the reward, rather than the words that you read at the end. My final words are, I wish I had just watched someone else play this game on youtube, because I only enjoyed about 15 of my time with this game, and thats being generous. Im glad that I paid for it and that the dev got my business, because this is a good story, but even after paying for it and playing through it, I would have rather paid them to watch the game play out, rather than be as angry and frustrated with the combat mechanics that you had to deal with. EDIT What the hell are you doing here, man? This review is 7 years old. Undertale is still kinda mid, though. SUPER EPIC SEX MAN has the right of it - shoulda given it a 3 or somethingYou see that shit Im saying down in those comments? I thought I was sick with it. How embarrassing is that?A suprisingly mediocre game in most respects that caught viral attention for its lowbrow memetic nature and pander-y writing.Each character is a rather shallow archetype exclusively designed as relatable and using slapstick humor to make them lovable quickly enough so that by the time the short campaign runtime ends you feel attached with fake feelings and look at the game less critically.The game is short. I understand that it was made by one person, but if youre judging it as a game rather than a game made by a person, then this is an obvious complaint. As a game, its got very easy gameplay even in genocide, thats literally just a pattern memorization grind and honestly, the art is pretty mediocre. The spritework is fine, and some environments are nice, but overall it could use improvement in several respects.The music is fantastic, and I have no complaints there. The main problem I have with Undertale is that its been elevated far higher than what it really is. An O.K. game, and one I couldnt really enjoy all that much. It got the public attention because it was designed to be able to generate a cancerous fanbase, with its somewhat barebones story and archetypal characters. Many reasons it gains its fame is because of the cardboard intrigue as I call it, where a writer purposefully adds a buried and underdeveloped character to incite a mad dash for information Gaster, and its got a shock value with its endings that make you want to talk about it with your friends.Its an O.K. RPG. Not a great one, with particularly uninteresting writing and characters that I could not get attached to with their annoying slapstick nature and their short appearances, which can be attributed to the short game runtime. The only other thing it could fall back on is gameplay, which is also rather dissapointing.Id give it a 610, based on my own personal opinions. Feel free to downvote if I made you mad, it doesnt really accomplish anything. The story, dialogue, and characters of Undertale are charming, and the conflict resolution is a change from the ordinary, but that being said there are a lot of things wrong with this game1. Retro art Yes, we get it, its retro, just like old games used to be. While its interesting to see how much the game is able convey through a minimalist approach, the limitations of the visuals for the budget of the game seem to be taking the easy way out. Dont want to put in long hours with amazing graphics? Use minimalist graphics and limit your potential! Thats why I draw in MS Paint so nobody realized I am a bad artist because I use a terrible medium as my excuse.2. The sound Again, retro, hooray. Some neat-o arrangements, but once again intentionally limited to retro style. You cant critique the peace as if it was a sweeping heart-wrenching orchestral piece if it sounds like the background song from a Final Fantasy area. The renditions people have done of the game music on YouTube is enough to show how much better it would have been with a less limited medium.3. The characters Considering that they were literally 2d, many of the behaviors of the characters were surprisingly deep... and then others seemed like obnoxious forced anime tropes. Alphys, Undyne, Mettaton, especially considering the depth of the story you find behind Alphys during the pacifist playthrough, sheit was surprisingly cardboard. Look here is a nerdy tumblr user and her too-perfect fish-lady ninja naruto lover. On one hand a person could say that all the characters were all just innocent and childish, Lets date. This is a date? Date harder. How does one date? Spaghette. but then when theyre also supposed to be portrayed as a crazy-intelligent scientist with a troubled past, there is a major continuity error. Is this character supposed to be clueless and adorable? Or world-weary and emotionally devastated? 4. The dialogue For as much as this game got right, it got a whole lot horribly wrong. Memes? Really? You want to make a timeless game that breaks the paradigm of all the others in its genre... yet your source of humor is memes? Internet references? As a result the game is dated and will only become more obscure over time instead of classic.4. The gameplay The dialogue options and unique battle scenarios are interesting for the first time or to you see them, but it gets to a point where it just gets repetitive. Oh the seahorse showed up again? Let me spam flex until I can walk 20 more steps for the repeat of this Pokemon encounter.5. The fanbaseYou guys suck. You are the main reason this game sucks in any way that it does. If someone wants to play through the game and experience some sort of wonder or emotion through it, they will immediately be torn out of that by the people who drool all over it. And even worse, these horrible fans arent celebrating any of the admirable qualities of the game, not the story, unique aspects, or conclusion their focus is just fanart. Oh the game has animal-like monsters? Someone call up the furries so they can crank out as much horrible cringeworthy porn that completely throws the rest of the game in the dumpster. Whats that? A character that represents a doting, loving, overly-concerned grandmother? Make porn of it. A socially inept scientist who has ruined the lives of countless happy families? Porn. A little child that is trapped in a repeating nightmare of unhappiness and forever tormenting the ones he loves? Well... he has goat ears, so make more porn of him than any other character in the game. Im not even going to talk about all the people who are so unoriginal that they have to adopt the characters from the game to represent themselves with traits they feel incapable of possessing Humor sans, Remorsededicationcompassionpower asriel, self-confidence papyrus, competence undyne, likability toriel.So to the 2 people who will ever read this review to the end congratulations. Now you know why even if you enjoy this game, you will immediately and permanently feel a growing loathing and discomfort around it after encountering any of its fans. Maybe youre one of the 10 people who walked away from the game with something substantial other than a couple of new fursona ideas or names to google for fan art, but it doesnt matter youre in the minority. Nobody else will understand the feelings you felt in the game, or care about any of the plot, they just care that there is so much new porn available now. Congrats Undertale, you are the new FNAFSonicPokemonMyLittlePonyFurry addition, thats all you will ever be now. Surprisingly, the game failed to hook me in despite its fame and creativeness. The puzzles are fine, and the humor is pretty good, yet the battle system felt quite tiresome and discouraging. However, I cannot call it bad in fact, it has the potential to exploreit is just not my cup of tea.I would have chosen a neutral review if I could. The game is good, but personal experience is rather disappointing. Maybe one day I can try again. Wasnt for me, might be for you. I appreciate what its going for and trying to achieve, it just didnt really gel together for me.I didnt really enjoy the moment-to-moment gameplay, and while I did enjoy the characters and twists, I found it all a bit too random and disjointed overall. The easiest way to explain is, everything felt like the set-up for a bit, constantly. That was fun and charming for the first few hours, but it kinda felt like I was clicking through someones stand-up material by the 6 hour mark. It didnt feel like I was existing in a world, because nothing felt connected or cohesive.Entirely possible it just didnt hit me like it hit other people, so Id say make your own mind up. These are just my thoughts I like writing these things, as silly as that is. I enjoyed what I played for the most part, I dont regret trying it. To start off the guide I would like to say that I would probably recommend this game to anyone, but if you are looking in or at negative reviews you are probably looking for good examples of the games shortcomings and what might make it deserve a negative review.To drown out the Why are you looking at negative reviews?!?! reviews, I will make this review.The game has a great story and many aspects that generate immersion, BUT a huge, specific, part of the game revolves around a literal grindfest making it very drawn out as well as carpal tunnel inducing.Overall the gameplay is honestley not very innovative or new. Its basically a bullet time game that only offers immersion through character interactions aside from combat. If you want to enjoy the game I would not recommend going rambo and fighting everyone. Its boring and time consuming.The game is also locked to 30fps and is hard on the eyes as a result. Especially when your characters 3 frame walking animation is centered and the world stutters around you. So the game is not very good looking. HOWEVER the atmosphere is there if you look past the oldtimey graphics and listenlook at everything else.Last but not least, i would say the biggest downfall of the game is that, while it rewards extenstive long session of play, it really does punish players that dont want to put hours and hours into the game. I played the game extesivley before buying it so my steam hours are not representative and i can say that if you want to save time and experience the whole game you have to look up a lot of what to do. It not very intuative. So the games depth is almost SO deep that is actually detracts from the game if you dont want to play it for literally days on end. Its hard on the eyes and it is hard on the patience of the player. overa great game but for you guys looking for a comprehesive negative review I would not recommend.but i sorta would...  forgive me for i have sinned I really didnt get it, it frustrated me so much to feel I wasnt playing right by simply playing and making decisions completely unaware.After playing some other meta games, like Inscryption and the Hex, I may give it another try. Should I do it, fellow player? Edit I played the neutral ending. Killed a dummy at the beginning thinking I was supposed to.Maybe I dont have a soul, maybe I just expected to much from all of the hype, but Undertale just didnt do for me what it did for others. Discussing with a friend, they had it all suddenly click about half way through the game and they fell in love with the story and its characters. On the other hand, I never had this experience. Without trying to spoil it, the game plays loosely like a JRPG. You meet many characters along the way, and youll notice a lot of other reviews praise the story and its character development. The characters are quirky and might resonate better with fans of Earthbound, but I found the weak jokes and humor they gave to detract from the more serious message the game is trying to share. In fact, Id have labeled the character development and story as pretty shallow, so Im surprised to see how amazing the feedback is regarding the game. The message is pretty in-your-face from the get-go, and you have a good idea where the story is going within a minute or two of starting. With the choices it offers the player as well, the game plays fairly black-and-white in its judgement of the player. It iasks you to make choices throughout the game, but they never seem to matter as much as youd hope. This ends up robbing the experience of any depth youd expect. This was the other issue I ran into maybe its because I just played SOMA, another game steeped in story and character development focused on a deep existential concept, but the main message of this game seems tame and weakly presented, and if they characters dont resonate with you, it kind of fails to bring any deeper meaning to the game.I wrote this review not to call this a bad game, but to let potential buyers know that not everyone derived an emotional and thoughtful experience from this game. It isnt the perfect game that the reviews seem to reflect. It will likely connect with some players, but I believe there are better games sharing the same messages. I play games for the story. While the story started off well the gameplay itself soon began to detract from it. I found both the battle system and NPCs in general tedius. The puzzles were fun but too simple for my taste. After three hours of waiting for it to get good I gave up.Perhaps if I were twenty years younger Id find the game more appealing. To me it felt like a game made for someone with no attention span. During my three hours almost nothing seemed to develop beyond amusing behavior. The gameplay felt erratic generally as well puzzles, battles, areas. Im not sure how to follow or get into a game that does that. Thus I felt no reason to continue playing.That being said I was suprised on occasion. There are some gems here and there that are quite precious and display wisdom far beyond the years of the creator. I will also add that I absolutely love the music and will continue to enjoy the soundtrack for years to come. While I cannot recommend the game itself I do recommend the soundtrack. I used to really enjoy this game, racking up 19 hours of total playtime. Looking back on the game, I find that most of my enjoyment came from the hype.Now, you can call me heartless for hating a game with such emotional depth, but Ive gotten more emotional over Mother 3, a game released 12 years ago from this date, and I HAVENT EVEN PLAYED IT.Unlike some reviews, I will actually go in-depth as to why I dont like each feature. Storyline This may be one that many will be pissed about, but I didnt find the story good. Like, at all. Basically, Theres a war, the royal son gets killed, he turns into a flower or something, and theyre trapped. Its hard to feel bad about the characters when the story is incredibly bland and leaves so much more to be imagined. Characters Two words Just. Tropes.The characters are entirely sorry for using this word again bland and their entire personalities are just tropes. Like take fan favorites Sans and Papyrus for example. Papyrus is charismatic and boisterous. Sans is relaxed and snarky. Thats it. No development. Even in death, Papyrus never changes. HumorWriting I do have to say the character writing wasnt awful. Each characters dialogue fit their character pretty nicely, and some of it was pulled off nicely. The only problem with that was...It wasnt funny.Now, I understand that humor is subjective, but I could barely bring myself to laugh even when I enjoyed it. I just didnt find it funny. You can think of it what you want, but I personally didnt find it funny. Again, its all subjective. Gameplay I could only describe it as tedious. Especially in later fights in the game, like Asgore. Sure, its a novel idea, but it gets boring after the first few times. I even gave up on the genocide route because of how pointless it was. Its not rewarding, its not fun in the slightest, and it was boring. Music The music was probably my favorite part of the game, and still is. There was lots of variety, it was funky and fit the mood most of the time, and is still extremely catchy. Sadly, its one of the only things I can say I enjoyed. Final Verdict Story 210Characters 410Writing  610Humor 110Gameplay 510Music 1010I personally do not judge graphics, I feel as the gameplay aspects are more important.I wont think of you any less if you like the game, as long as you stay civil about it. After all, we all have the right to say whatever we want. I enjoyed the story, but the gameplay wasnt interesting to me. I know that many others would disagree with me on that, but it just didnt entertain me.",
        "summary": "Undertale has some amazing music if you enjoy that soundstyle, some cool game mechanics the mini games for avoiding attacks, some nice sentiments and lessons, and a couple interesting fourth wall breaking moments. People will hate me for saying this, but it just isnt everyones cup of tea. You may really enjoy this game, but dont feel like you have to..."

When we play, I set up the base, make sure the power stays on and the healroot is harvested. The mother of my children, the light of my life, sits next to me and plays the game by suggesting things like The colony could make far more silver if we were to simply imprison raiders, remove organs, skin, butcher and consume their flesh. I thought I knew everything about this lady. Damn. Weve spent all 1,176 hours in this game together. After about 5,000 hours played I started to feel like the game was getting a little stale.  Thats about 12 a penny per hour of enjoyment.  I would say Rimworld has been the most value purchase Ive made in my entire life. 2022... hours played clocked on Steam so far. Seems kind of silly making a review for this game at this point, but I figured I should at least give it a thumbs up.

When you play this game, make sure to get yourself a real one like Ratatouille.R.I.P Ratatouille, loyal to the end Ive been playing this game for the first time and I want to share the story of how I realized its kind of amazing.The last of my three original colonists, a female trader named Onesan, died nine years after founding the colony. The story of her life on the planet is what amazed me and it convinced me this game is something special. It actually made me a little emotional. None of what Im going to say is fake, this all happened.Onesan arrived on the planet with her sister Min, a 16 year old K pop star, and her best friend August, a miner. Min died early on from injuries she took during a caravan ambush. Barely a year after that, August bled to death from injuries she received during a very bad pirate raid on the colony. Onesan broke down often in the early years.By year three the only person Onesan knew well in the colony was her husband, Steel. Onesan and Steel had gone through a very rocky courtship. It took two years of awkward back and forth flirting before Steel finally won her over. But after three years of marriage, Steel was seduced by another colonist, and Onesan separated from him. Despite Steels cheating she never broke down again. She couldnt afford to. She was the colonys lead trader and negotiator. Onesan was always busy, constantly on the road between her colony and the friendly one nearby. During the periods when she wasnt on the road, she tailored clothes for the rest of the colony. Steel stayed on his side of the colony, working on armor and weapons. For years they rarely ran into each other despite the relatively small size of the colony. Eventually, the relationship with the neighboring colonies changed, and the trade deals began to dry up. After her final return trip, Onesan was suddenly very eager to be with her estranged husband again. It seemed like all the time and distance apart helped her to forgive him. In a strange cosmic coincidence, Steel had broken up with the other colonist while Onesan had been away on her last trip. They got back together, and for one more year they enjoyed each other more than they ever had before. On the day she died, Onesan was hunting near the edge of the map, far away from the colony. A large pack of manhunting arctic wolves entered the map almost on top of her. Onesan was ripped to shreds and bled to death before Steel and everyone else had even left the safety of the walls. As the final member of the original colonists and the colonys informal leader, Onesan deserved the best possible funeral. A catacomb was excavated for her deep inside the nearby mountain, and a solid silver sarcophagus was placed inside for her to rest in. Steel constructed the sarcophagus for his wife personally. It was excellent quality.He titled the sarcophagus Shadow of Onesan. The description readsThe sarcophagus is engraved with a picture of Ryoko Onesan Minase practicing construction skills with visible exhaustion. Hundreds of cowboys watch with amazement. The work seems to represent suffering. The lower part of the image is dominated by a large group of shamans. This representation tells the story of Onesan becoming a master at construction tasks on 5th of Septober, 5509.You can see a screenshot I took of it here. httpssteamuserimages-a.akamaihd.netugc7818572704610470072BD4EB8FCD3C4627D00A25CDB42AC71B4F179355Im not sure why, but Onesans death did not make Steel upset. I know she was important to him, though. He would leave his work at the machining bench all the time to visit her sarcophagus. Hed always be there for a long time, staring down at it. Ive been paying closer attention to him since Onesan died, and as far as I can tell he hasnt flirted with any of the other colonists since her death.Eventually I decided that Steel was going to focus on leading Onesans people off the planet. Now he sits at the research bench every day, slowly unlocking the path to the stars. I like to imagine that someday when the ship is ready he will send her people off, but instead of going with them he will stay behind on the planet to be with her. The game is worth waiting 30 minutes each time you open it because of all the mods you enabled. Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her Butters, but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around wood.- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our village a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.Im skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - youll learn about this on the spot yourself.- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some bone. Good for her.- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.But then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didnt want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.- Hunter, however, eventually shot  killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin monkey.- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.- By the time that weve managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!Now, heres a lesson Ive learned Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.- Now, the house in which Butters was still recovering was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. - Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. - So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up  down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. - I made Bones, since hes supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. - The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into what it seemed a neverending sea of flames and emotion.- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.After the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came What kind of fed up game is that?Rimworld, my dear. Its Rimworld. -true story- As you can see Ive been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLCs which, to me, is very exciting. The makers of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try! Ive been fiddling around with challenging game modes rather than the stock three. So I began a game with absolutely nothing other than the starting colonist, no food, no weapon, no silver. Ive then opted then to go for a mountainous region cause its easier to defend from attackers.This is where things get interesting, normally what happens now is you get to choose your colonist. I thought Right, i want a good miner, someone who can farm relatively well and I guess a good fighter to start off with. Off I go cycling through the colonists where I stumble upon Patrice. Patrice was shit at everything, Im talking zeros, ones and twos across the board, with the exception of Art which was seven and Social which was bloody eighteen.I thought to myself, how the hell does she have such a high social skill so I read her backstory. Now Patrice was just twenty years old, very young but she had done so much. Patrice wanted to sing for everybody, luckily for her, Dad was the CEO of an interplanetary corporation and set her up as a Childhood Idol. Patrice sang her poor heart out for everybody and made her parents proud. Until her mum died, dad was beside himself, lost in his thoughts, Patrice at this stage was developing into a woman and offered herself to dad as a replacement for mum which he accepted....The shenanighans went on until the corporation executives discovered Patrice and dads secret and gave dad an ultimatum, Give us your daughter or we go public with whats been happening between you two, ruining both your lives in the process. Dad agreed and sent poor Patrice away.The executives kept Patrice in an orbital station on the galactic fringes far away from daddy, where they used Patrice for a new kind of job, if you know what I mean, say hello to Patrices adult background Pornographic Idol. Yes you read that correctly, Patrice was now sold into sexual slavery. But it wasnt all that bad, she wasnt a typical whore as it where, more like a Companion from Firefly where she selected her clients. She became very popular amongst the nobility of the region. Attended balls and had a cult following, much like her childhood.I thought to myself Holy crap Batman WTF did I just read?. This story was absolutely nuts, I had to try to help Patrice live a better life. Off we went to Patrices new home. Im assuming at this stage shes been rescued by some unknown benefactor. Anyway, Patric lands right in the centre of a small clearing surrounded by mountain with only one opening and fertile land within that area too. Score!! I thought as I got her to work setting up a shelter, bed and torch. Bloody hell wasnt this a task for her? It took two days to complete this menial task but together we persevered. Eventually she completed this task cutting down a dozen trees in the process and skilling up two levels in construction.Then the feral rabbit came knocking, Crap I had to get her to safety, fortunately this rabbit tired itself rather quickly and left Patrice alone after it slept. I got Patrice to fashion herself a club to use and just in the nick of time, well I say nick of time but it took her a whole day to get this done too. At this stage she hasnt even gotten to setting up a farm, luckily there are heaps of wild berries around.A visitor arrives and Patrice says hi but she has no goods to sell so they leave in a hurry, as they are leaving sirens roar as were under attack. The attacker has a shiv, loves to fight and has eight skill. Were finished I think as the attacker runs down towards the village but attacks the visitor, the visitor manages to put a solid slug into the attacker but is killed in the process. The attacker is wounded but proceeds to move towards Patrice, I order Patrice to stay behind the door ready with her club. The attacker busts the door down and charges in but after suffering from blood loss Patrice is able to knock him out with a single swing from her club.Patrice locks him up in her room after fixing the door and manages to stop the bleeding thanks to some bandages the visitor had. Then I got to see Patrice do what she did best, talk to people. You see what normally happens is these attackers are hard as nails to recruit to your village, with some taking days and even seasons before joining your community, Patrice didnt even need food to entice him, as soon as she walked into the room he instantly switched sides and became Patrices bitch. Patrice was a God amongst men as she began her new dynasty, Patrice settled into her new roles as town artist and socialite, while minion one got to work erecting a wall, finishing some farmland and contructing a kitchen and dining room for Patrice to enjoy, all in a days work as it were.Patrice gathered up the supplies the visitor donated equiping herself with a rifle in the process and set to work skilling up. It was like a switch was flicked, now she had a minion to dominate she finished everything with precision and haste. She developed a taste in gardening as the minion went to work digging out the tunnels, constructing two cells for conversation duties and completing a new throne room and Queens chambers for Patrice.This is where the story of Patrice ends..... for now... Im actually looking forward to resuming the tale of Patrice.Rimworld can be full of trash, normally I would look purely at the stats of a character to pick them for me but Patrice has changed my attitude here, now I look at the stories these colonists have as the main driving factor in selecting them.Edit Just getting my point for a review, listing Rimworld for GOTYFYI I have the Patrice save file, played a touch, shes still alive. I saw a YouTuber playing this game, I loved it so much that I immediately wanted it... so I pirated it and it was good, so good that I deleted it saved up and paid for it with my Birthday money. Best purchase ever. I cant recommend it enough. Also, try a few mods... Rimworld is a game of story telling. And warcrimes.One such case my faction was raided by the ruthless pirate faction - one of their largest raids yet. They were throwing everything they had at me. Powered armor, miniguns, plasma weaponry. It was a hard fought battle. But something caught my eye at the start, a particular soldier with remarkable stats and the best geared of the group. This man was the faction leaders son. Not long after their raid turned south i began harvesting organs from the survivors as per routine. But I had something evil planned for the son. I decided to turn him into my only prisoner. I removed his limbs and left him with only what he needed to live, and fed him his fallen comrades from the most recent raid. After all was done, I loaded him into a cargo pod and launched him at his fathers homelands. To send a message.It wasnt long before they responded. Hard. A raid of immeasurable size came back, the son that I had launched at them prior was with the group - with him his father. His limbs restored with advanced bionics far beyond any mundane soldier. Randy Random the god of my world, had decided that my evil acts would not go unchecked A solar flair hit my base at the same time, knocking out my defences. Leaving my 5 super soldiers versus their army. It was a bloody fought battle.The faction leader was one of the first to fall, and their numbers were thinning. A wrongly placed missile wiped half their own, but took out 2 of my super soldiers in the blast. One died to shrapnel to the skull instantly. The other clinging to life on the ground. My three other soldiers were dropping one by one, until the enemy faction decided to flee, attempting to take what they could and leave after facing such casualties. The son of the faction, ready to leave to take up his fathers position of leader had planned to take one of my super soldiers of his own, but I couldnt face to let that happen. Beaten and bruised I had a single soldier still standing whom ran to face the son in a one on one, hand to hand fight. Mano a mano. My soldier, their arms fitted with blades within their wrists like some kind of horrifying techno wolverine, the enemy stood strong, head to toe in bionics like a bloodied terminator. The first punch was thrown by my soldier, ripping his arm off in one. But machine parts dont feel, and he didnt flinch to the pain. He threw his one and only punch. Powered by bionics a servo punch so strong it ripped my soldiers bionic jaw off in one, dropping him to the ground. And that was how my colony of 5 super soldiers ended. Karma. 1010 would commit warcrimes and face the consequences again. Amazing game, its hard to describe it!Want to follow the base game and role play a group of spacefarers crash landed on a Rimworld, struggling to survive, build tech from neolithic to scifi, navigating politics of the new world seeking allies and defending against hostile factions, insects and robots? Sure you can do that, but the mods, my god the mods! Want to role play a squad of Warhammer 40,000 Space Marines? You can do that. Starship Troopers? You can do that. Want to add realistic nuclear power plants with turbines, cooling systems, fuel rods, storage pools etc etc. Sure add the mod in. Want people to use the toilet and have a bath and get cranky if they dont. Done. Want to role play evil cannibals that worship vampires as gods and have a vampire as your colonys leader. Done. Prisoners work the vast fields of rice and corn rather than just wasting away in a jail. Easy as. Tired of having your colonists doing all the work, make androids and robots do all of the heavy lifting. Build a space ship and have space combat, raid space stations? in 1.2 I was having a blast with that. If you get bored with high tech, make the game become a fantasy world with elves, gnomes, goblins and orcs - wizards, witches, warlocks, weapon masters, drunken monks and barbarian warriors. Maybe create a viking village that just want to grape the women, steal the horses, enslave those too weak to defend themselves and bring glory to your clan and gods? You can do that too. How about a castlevillage commanded by a demon who feeds off of his subjects, who uses his army of zombies to raid villages to capture more man flesh for the demon king. Yep you can do that. Or a humble way station with stables, restaurant, high born inn, low class flophouse, and of course a tavern, just trying to get by in a crazy fantasy world to turn a profit by providing goods and services to anyone with enough coin to pay? You can do that.So yes, Ive played thirty one hundred hours of this game over seven years because I can make it do whatever the heck I can dream up and thats freaking awesome! When I was first recommended this game, I thought to myself, Man, 30 for some indie game I have never heard in my damned life. Sounds like a scam to me.Well, as it turns out, I bought it anyway. And for what the 30 is worth?Its a fucking scam.The game plays out where you have a couple people on a ship, or something, and crashlanding into what is pretty much a space version of the wild west.These pawns are what pretty much what you use to play the game. You essentially kind of psudeo-control these pawns that dont have functioning brains, and you set up schedules, work priorities, all that colony simulator stuff. The entire game is just based around managing your colony at least, thats what my first impressions were.A random bandit raid comes 30 minutes into the game. Only one guy. Probably a self-proclaimed pirate. No big deal, my pawns just gunned him down.Now, we have this unslightly guy outside of our base, bleeding out because he thought he could 1v3 my colony like he was some Metal Gear assassin sort of guy.Oh, then I checked his stats.You see, in this game, pawns have these designated stats that are all trainable. These stats are sort of like an RPG trope ordeal where you have to train them at those skills so they get better stats. The pawns I started out with, one was an okay constructor, the other a doctor, and the third one was not good at anything, but she could still kind of get the job done.Now, this pirate?He had the most atrocious stats I have ever seen in my life. In fact, he was only good at one thing, which was punching. Couldnt even help with the farm or anything because he was incapable of doing so. Any sort of skilled labor just wasnt his thing.Still, I decided to tidy him up, and try to recruit him. After all, you may be only good at one thing, but we sure as hell need a janitor to clean these dirty as hell rooms, since the dirt and grime was pretty much pissing off my pawns moodlet bars.Few hours go by, and Im already invested into this brawler janitor guy. You see, my colonists wanted everything. They wanted a good looking bedroom, a place to lounge in, some horseshoes to play with, but not the janitor dude.He was an ascetic. Gave him a garbage room with dirt as his floor and an awful bed. He didnt mind it. No, in fact, he was happy with it. This guy pretty much never had a crappy mood and just did his work, no questions asked. Cleaned the kitchen, the dining room, the bedrooms, the farms, the outside, without a single complaint. I liked him. He was cool.Our colony started booming. Naturally, when any colony starts to get rolling, they start rolling hard. And when the colony gets rolling, the money starts rolling right in.You see, we were the biggest dealer in corn that the world had ever seen. Every time a trading caravan from a neighboring colony came in, we got ourselves a giant wad of cash for every harvest of every year. And with that giant wad of cash, as any functional human being would do, we started spending that on a bunch of cool as hell stuff. Shield belts. Charge rifles. Bionic body parts. Gigantic statues. And of course, an EXCESS amount of chocolate. Because why the hell not.Well, of course, since we were pretty much balling on money, people started to take notice. And, unfortunately, not all of them were good people.Pirate raids started to come in, and we fought them off every time. Every time we finished a raid, wed go ahead, and try to recruit some of these guys. Some of them joined, others were still hesitant. Sooner or later, we had a massive prison size of 11 people, and 7 people as colonists. With that population, food was bound to dwindle, but I figured that it wouldnt have mattered since we were in a tropical rain forest, where food was everywhere, and farming season was pretty much all the time.I was woefully unprepared for the events to come.Some other city thought that it was an absolute GENIUS idea to use their chemical radioactive fuel or whatever, and as it turned out, it wasnt so genius after all. My entire region was poisoned. By toxic fallout.Thing is, its impossible to grow crops outside in a toxic fallout. So my entire crop system started dying out.Well, I figured, maybe we can hold out on food stores for a while, and I did just that.Food stores cut in half after the first week. Toxic fallout wasnt letting up any time soon, so I was forced to let go of the prisoners outside to fend for themselves. My colony was going to be eaten out of food, and I wasnt going to let my colonists starve just to feed some idiots who do not understand the gloriousness of my colony.Luckily for me, the fallout lifted right before our food stores would hit zero. Of course, right after that happened, I started hauling ass, telling my pawns to get to work farming right away so we would have food again.Then, a ship crashlands straight into the north side of my base.I had no idea what that thing was. It sat there for a few days, humming some weird crap, then I noticed that it was making snow. And killing plants around it.It was the same god damned toxic fallout thing, but this time, it was spreading from the ship.I hated toxic fallout. It forced me to let go of all the prisoners I was about to recruit. It made me lose farming time that could have been spent farming corn.So naturally, with my hate for this poison ship, I woke up my colonists, and then attacked the ship.What happened next, I couldnt believe it.Robot aliens. Counted 4 super-sized centipede slug things and 5 scyther robot things. I have never seen robot aliens up until this point, so I had no idea what these things were capable of.We started shooting them down.The mechanoids were not fazed.One of the scythers took a shot. Aimed it. Fired.My best shooter instantly died as the charged weapon shredded his brains out.I was forced to move retreat back to the base, where the sandbags were so they could take cover.Meanwhile, the centipedes just arrived as reinforcements after the scythers were sniping my main defending force off one by one.The centipedes started mowing everyone down colonists died left and right.The only people left at this point was the doctor, who was bleeding out fast, and the janitor, who was rescuing the doctor to the hospital.In a last ditch effort to try to save what I had left, I sent my janitor to rush into the fray.As he charged in, a scyther instantly broke his shield with a well-timed shot. The janitor cleanly swiped off the scythers neck, downing it, and then moved onto the next scyther.A bystanding scyther, watching this take place, takes fire only to accidentally shoot his ally directly in the thorax.With it down, he moved towards the last scyther.This time wasnt so lucky for him.The fourth scyther sliced at his right arm, destroying it, as the scyther dodged his attacks, and sliced again at his neck, swiftly decapitating his head clean off.In a manner of minutes, my entire colony was dismantled. The buildings were razed in an inferno, and all my colonists had died, save for one. The doctor, whimpering in the corner of the hospital the floor soaked in her own blood.I watched for the last few minutes as she bled out, and died right there. Alone, as the building around her burnt into ashes and crumbled.I felt bad. My colony was short-lived. I thought I had it all. I thought I was invincible. Hell, I survived a toxic fallout. Of course I thought I was invincible. And I was so invested into that colony too.So, I decided. This game is a god damn scam. What kind of sane developer makes me feel this emotion, in a video game no less? A crook, thats who. For 30, you made me suffer. You made me addicted to this game, to the point where I have played for a total of 300 hours as of this review.All I can say, Tynan Sylvester, is that you are a crook. A damned good one, at that. I play naked brutality, randy random and merciless on permadeath. Needless to say most of my games dont last long, but i love the challenge.In my last game my solo guy got attacked by a hungry bear and managed to kill him with just his knife 1 deadfall trap, but he still collapsed from the pain. I waited anxiously to see if he would recover on his own and when he did i changed his title to the The Revenant. He got a scratch scar and made himself a pair of pants from the bearskin.For me this game is like a book.When i read a book i use my imagination to draw the characters and places using the authors descriptive writing and i can watch the drama and action unfold in my head.When i play this game, I find myself doing the same thing. The character traits and the story teller events create a story and i can image the live action movie behind the games pixels.I definately recommend. The rating of Rimworld should be enough to tell you that this game is greatPossibly the best game Ive ever played and Ive been playing video games for over 20 years now. Graphics - I personally really like the graphics. They are simple, but it fits the game well and I couldnt imagine how better graphics could make the game significantly better.Music - fits the game perfectly and some how after all this time of play, doesnt seem to get old.Story - each game is different, there are similarities because your still playing rimworld but youll never get the same game twice. Each game tells its own story of survival, disaster and occasionally triumph.Ease of play - the tutorial is pretty bad from memory. BUT once you complete the tutorial and then die in your first winter because you dont have enough food and restart and prepare for winter and forget to add defences and die then restart and add defences then try hunting a heard of Muffalo in preparation for winter and die again because the whole heard turns manhunter you learn enough along the way with relative ease.Replayability - endlessly look at my hours of playOverall rating - 1010 - I was looking for a game that was in the survival genre. Something that you build a colony, you have to manage food and weather conditions and you have to defend the colony from enemies. I found Rimworld, I got engulfed in Rimworld, and I havent played anything else apart from Rimworld. My dreams of running a drug-farming gun running human trafficking organ harvesting capitalistic cannibalistic colony run by gene-vat soldiers that rely on liquid cocaine to survive and have ZERO social skills can finally be achieved I got mauled by a bear in the first ten seconds. He just showed up, ate my entire civilization and left. big Ive been playing since alpha 6, and this game is great.This is the recent story of my A14 colony.Mate touches down on the planet, with his cat, Enrique. He is great at construction and growing.We plant Potatoes and dig a hole for ourselves.New guy comes in, AMAZING at mining.He goes crazy because he slept on the cave floor.Mate shoots him 17 times because he punched him in the gut.He dies.New lady comes in, chased by pirates.Grabs pistol off dead man, capture pirate with amazing speech.Mates Father parachutes in like YO SON, I GOT AN INFECTION IN MAH KNEEWe harvest, food is good.Mates Father dies of infection, Mate dies inside.Prisoner with great speech dies of infection.New guy comes! Good speech, amazing construction.Pirates attack.Mid attack, architect has a mental breakdown because I told him to wake up to try to save Mates dads life.He attacks and kills a chinchilla while the pirates shoot him with shoddy pistols.THEY KILL MY GODDAMN CATMate goes on a mental breakdown rampage because they killed his cat.He slaughters them all.Lady patches him up.They become lovers.They get married.They get happier, though noone else comes for a long time.Together, they fend off wave after wave of pirates, and the local tribe comes to our aid.New guy comes in, HAS 15 FUCKING POINTS IN SHOOTINGMate gives pulse rifle to new guy.Bugs infest us, Sniper snipes them as they walk out.We lock them in the room to farm the jelly.We decide there is enough in there, and slaughter most of them as they try to stop our boi from stealing jelly.Rinse and repeat, we have a jelly farm now.We prosper, forgetting the tragedies of the past.We recruit 10 others, a camel, and a Panther.We build a ship, to space we must go!50 Goddamn pirates come in.We hide in our space pods.15 shooter guy guards the entrance, getting everyone inside. Mate, now an old man, with now, a shooting skill of 11, defends the line along with his power armoured brother.The turrets fall, and explode.I send our emergency pet boomalope to ALAN SNACKBAR them.Mate falls, shot many times, his armour pierced. He is still alive, his best friend, the 15 shooter guy, kills another pirate, and picks him up. He is shot many times in the back as he runs his friend to the cryosleep module.As he puts him in, he breaks, and kills the last of them.Our doctor gets out, and carries him into his pod, the last one.We leave behind 50 bodies, and a functioning colony.There is nothing there but tragedy now.Since this got so big, I just gotta say, you need to give the game a chance, because there is quite a big learning curve if you arent used to it, Rimworld, a MasterpieceDo not get fooled by its simplistic approach to graphics  design. Rimworld is an highly complex colony simstory generator absolutely packedwith details, refreshing gameplay mechanics to mess around with, and that with uttermost freedom. The concepts are all simple enough to learn and there is a neat built-in tutorial. Once the few interface paradigms are mastered then youre most of the way there. Dont worry, you will get acquainted with the game fast enough because the game will suck up all of your free time. Once youll know how to operate the ship, youll never want to stop sailing away.Certified mod friendlyUnlike your first colony, the modding community is flourishing and far from dying. You can completely transform your experience but my favourite type are the Quality of life mods that make the base game notably more delectable. The variety is huge and brings endless possibilities to an already very replayable game. My advice for new players would be to get some of the QoL mods, get a good grab of the game and notice what you wish were or werent in the game. After a bit of research you will end up realising theres a mod for almost everything.One of my favourite discovery of 2023, without a doubt.1010",
        "summary": "Rimworld has been the most value purchase Ive made in my entire life. After about 5,000 hours played I started to feel like the game was getting a little stale. This is the kind of game you sit down to at like nine oclock, and the next time you blink, the sun will be rising."

        "text": "I would have recommended this game very enthusiastically. However they changed the EULA years after i purchased the game and now the new EULA they want you to accept, requires you to sign away rights to the game license. For instance the old EULA did not include the clause where they can arbitrarily revoke your games license. It literally says in the new EULA to play a game you already OWN you have to agree to allow them the right to revoke your license at any time. They want you to go from OWNING the game, to LEASING. Where at anytime after you paid your lease could be canceled and not refunded. I consider this a breach of contract to prevent me from playing the game unless i agree to a coerced EULA. 010. I refuse to renegotiate a contract you already accepted my money for. The contract is closed, unless you want to pay me what i think my rights to the game is worth, any attempts like this is coercive is very illegal in the USA. The design of this game is pulled in two direction. On one hand, it wants to be a lightly comical story generator, as it says on the menu screen. Twists and turns! Watch your people be eaten by geese and fall in love! On the other, it wants to have relatively tight gameplay about logistics. If your planting zones are too big youve done messed up your optimization. These two demands kind of conflict with each other. After about 50 hours of play, I never really encountered the content freedom that made my runs feel unique, like a generated story. There arent 100 bizarre plot twists that occur, like weird obelisks that mesmerize you or mysterious wanderers. On the other hand, the plot that does happen -- getting sick or a prisoner making a break for it -- sometimes seem silly for sillys sake, and after enough time becomes subsumed to pretty regular gameplay. Often these happen as tick events, as taming an animal takes X tries at Y percent of success to reach Z quantity -- not exactly a story generator.Worse is that the time-scale is pretty unforgiving. There is an element of Haha can you believe my best colonist died because a cougar bit off his hand!?! but then the hours and hours of progression is in danger. The game seems to not want you to reload, to let things play out, but for me the game is paced a little too slowly and can go wrong so fast, that it just seems a little off. Reloading isnt fun, but then again, neither is accidentally hitting someone with a grenade after 15 hours of hard work, setting you back hours and hours.Another negative for me is that its a bit too much of a sandbox for starting conditions. Ostensibly, youre running a base of crashlanded strangers on a border planet. But you always crash land with the same materials, you get to pick exactly where you land, you can re-roll all your characters for hours if you want, if youre psycho like me. I tend to like beating official challenges, and the freedom here LOTS of opportunity for meta play at the beginning, i.e. rerolling, restarting was not a plus for me, and seemed to contradict the story-generator sense. I eventually installed the Prepare Carefully mod. If you can re-roll ad nauseum, why not just spare yourself the time? This mod lets you create a character within self-imposed limits. i.e. attributes worth 1,500 points totalOverall, as my first foray into this kind of game, it was accessible and engrossing for a while. But 50 hours in, Im starting to grow a bit critical and frustrated with the game. That being said, Ive picked this game up off and on for a while now, so its obviously hit me from an unexpected angle.Bottom line, if youre trying to be careful with the games you spend time with so little life, too many games, Id consider being wary with it. Before launching into all the reasons RimWorld disappointed me, I do want to say that it isnt a terrible game. It really deserves a neutral review, maybe a 610. I enjoyed certain parts of the game, and Ive put more than enough hours into it to get my moneys worth. At the very least, the soundtrack is great. However, RimWorld suffers from way too many missed opportunities and shortcomings to give a positive review.  Colonist Development doesnt offer real choiceFirst off, I could not bring myself to care about my colonists, because player influence over long term pawn development is extremely limited. I think this can be broken down in to 3 main areas. Traits  The system with the biggest effect on pawn behavior is Traits. Unfortunately, traits can never change, and theyre decided entirely at character development.   Even in places where it seems obvious that you would be able to influence pawn traits, you cant. For example, one possible background is Glitterworld Surgeon, and the description suggests that this character has done a lot of plastic surgery. Why cant I have that pawn fix another pawn with the Ugly trait? Sprites  The biggest way pawns change is through injury or body part replacement. But this only manifests through numbers since pawn sprites are static. Get your jaw blown off? Doesnt matter, same sprite. Get a bionic eye replacement? Nope, same sprite, same eyes. As a means of conveying important information to the player, the UI and overall graphic design of this game SUCKS. Skills  Leveling skills isnt fun or engaging due to 3 problems. 1 The pawn has to be at least interested in the skill for it to be worth the effort to level. Interest is random, and decided entirely at pawn generation. 2 Their skills will always regress down to level 10, so the game is always dragging your pawns down to the same baseline. 3, Theres no choice or input, it just happens whenever they use that skill. For a game about managing people and influencing their fortunes, RimWorld does a terrible job of acknowledging the players lasting influences on the characters.  The RNG nature of events and storytelling shatters immersion in multiple ways. Most of the engaging i.e. not fast forwarding gameplay comes from random events generated by the storyteller, an A.I. director. Most of these events fall into the category of minor inconvenience, so theyre not even things that a player can meaningfully react to. E.g.  Someone got the flu. Good thing health care is completely automated and requires no input to resolve. The only time these issues are critical is when game systems interact in unintuitive and frustrating ways, like your doctor deciding that eating and sleeping is more important than treating illnesses and people end up dying, unless you tediously micromanage the situation more on this later.The flipside of this is that once your colony accrues a bit of wealth or exceeds a pawn count, it ramps up the difficulty and gives you events that far outclass your ability to handle them, e.g. a robot ship coming to kill you or two dozen man eating muffaloes rampaging through your base. In order to beat these events, you either have toA accept the RNG and let some pawns die,B save scum, orC Construct your base in an extremely gamey and immersion breaking way to trick the enemy AI into getting itself killed.      The map is pointlessly large, and only serves to make winning harderSo theres a neat feature where every major landmark in the world gets a name and a unique climate. This is a legitimately cool feature, but badly misplaced. The problem is that once you choose your starting location, you could cut 75 of the map away and it wouldnt matter. The game doesnt give you any real reason to experience the other 75 of the map. World events always spawn close to your settlement, and you can trade locally for everything you need. Packing up and rebuilding somewhere else is a huge, tedious ordeal, and isnt worth it. The reason for the huge map as far as I can tell is that the games win condition, escaping on a downed spaceship, is always located far away from your home base. To be fair, that journey can be fun, as finding clever ways to manage settlers moods, always wondering when the next ambush is, and building minimalist bases along the way gives a solid sense of progress, and is generally engaging. However, the game deliberately lets you circumvent that by building your own space ship anywhere, which requires an absurd amount of resources, which increases your wealth, which leads to absurdly hard events, as discussed above. Colonist AI is dumb and micromanagement is tedious. All of these complaints would be forgiven if the actual gameplay was fun and engaging, but its not. The solution to most of the games shortcomings is either A install a mod to fix the problem or B tediously micromanage the problem away. Some examples Hauling  Pawns are awful at logistics. Every pawn has the efficiency of hearses in Cities Skylines, which is NOT a compliment. If anything needs to be moved quickly, the player must manually select a pawn, and order them to haul that specific item. Oh, and some pawns have traits that prevent you from doing that. So if that pawn goes hunting, they will usually carry their kill back. But if anything interrupts that action, you cant force them to go back and bring their kill to the base. As Ive said before, sometimes game systems interact in frustrating, unintuitive ways. Crafting    When crafting items that take several ingredients, if you dont construct your base in a specific way to minimize travel time, pawns will waste 75 of their time just transporting ingredients in the least efficient way possible. In other games, solving logistics problems can be fun and engaging. I love Factorio and Cities Skylines but in those games, I feel like Im solving an interesting puzzle. In Rimworld, Im babysitting idiots that have no personality.Decison Making Pawns will very often neglect life or death situations to do something like eat or sleep. After a big raid, you might have some injuries. But rather than rescue a dying friend 2 feet from them, pawns might decide that they have to walk halfway across the map to eat, leaving their friend to die.  Uncontrollable Mood Modifiers Hungry pawns will walk across the map to get a meal, but not the extra 3 tiles to eat at a table. This cant even be manually controlled, so youre forced to accept the penalty to mood. There are a lot of examples of mood modifiers being outside of player control, this is just the most obvious one Ive found. What makes this even more stupid is that theres literally a random modifier that will give a mood bonus or penalty, this is just extra. Cooking  Theyve even added features since beta that only serve to give the player more to micromanage. As of beta 18, colonists get food poisoning if meals are cooked in a dirty kitchen. Yay realism! But apparently no one considered the gameplay ramifications. There is no way to assign individual cleaning locations so players wind up constantly micromanaging pawns to clean the kitchen. Boo tedium. Mods A lot of fans will tell you that mods fix a lot of these problems. Thats only partially true. Things like trait interaction and pawn development dont have mods that Im currently aware of.  Regardless, if a games quality can be judged after other people put work into it, then Unreal Engine would be the best game of all time.  TLDR While Rimworld is fun at times, its generally too tedious, and too limiting in player choice to get a recommendation from me. First off, I want to make clear that Im not hating on the game and Im happy for all the people who enjoy it the way it is, which is a lot of people if you check the reviews. But I wanted to leave this review for others like me who are not sure if the game is for them and leave some points to consider.What I enjoyed about Rimworld was the freedom it gives you in creating your colony and the stories you can create, and how every playthrough is different. The quests and interactions with other settlements also help creating an continually interesting expirience. I also enjoyed the ideology DLC, which I think gives it even more depth and customization options.But then theres everything that annoyed me. First thing was the atrocious UI. Not just the design and the menu hierarchy, but also how and where information is displayed. This, I think, is also true for the rest of the game. This is a shame, because information is such a central part of such games.And theres a lot of necessary information you have to figure out on your own or look up in the wiki, because the tutorial doesnt tell you, from clothes and armor to temperature, roofs, mental breaks and more. It was very frustrating to figure out that roof collapses are a thing by one of my colonists dying.And the last big thing that I think is important to consider before buying is the micromanagement of your colonists. Not just the colony, but every individual person. If youre into that, thats good for you, but this was a bit too much for my taste. I dont want to tell them to remove the roof before removing all walls of a building or that one rock is ok to mine and the other not, or else they die. Sometimes they are smart enough, like putting on better clothes when available, but other times they are stupid and go eat insect jelly in the middle of an infestation when on a food binge.And yes, there are mods to adress a great many of issues and change the game to your will. But if the game is just a canvas I have to fill with mods, then it should cost half than what it currently does.The game is still being worked on, and maybe things will change, in which case Ill adapt this review. But until then, I can not recommend to buy this at full price. As a similar game, I can recommend Prison Architect, which costs slightly less and offers a more refined expirience, imo. Probably gonna get chewed out for saying this but its rather expensive. There are a lot of things you can do, and a great modding community, but the game has a sort of false depth. Its like they have provided us a lot of tools, and its fun to use them while you are still figuring out as you wonder the extent of possibilities. But soon as you figure out the mechanics, you realize that its actually very simple. And while understanding the mechanics and triggers are essential part of arcade games, its counterintuitive for simulations. It makes it very difficult to maintain the suspension of disbelief and the game quickly loses its allureat least for me. I understand that simple mechanics are part of this games design philosophy and as a result the game holds very well mechanically. However, I feel that if you wanna create a simple game, keep it at a simple price. Some notes for players that are coming here after seeing hyped up videos from youtube The notes on paintings are randomly generated, and while they do have your characters name the context rarely make sense unless you really force yourself to make sense of it. The pawns have relationships in the sense that they either really like or hate each other and begin fights when they have too much mood debuff. They dont actually talk to each other. Just randomly generated logs talked about politicsdogs if they are in the vicinity. The pawns have traits like neurotic or pyro or beautiful. They affect either their skills or social standing. They dont have a personality as such. And traits are just a representation of what work they are good at shooting, cooking, some of which they are better at learning.   You can do a Warcrime playthrough. But the only effect in game you will notice is that your pawns and other colonists will have a mood debuff. It just another Wednesday in the Wild West. And the other colonies are pretty much non-existent. They dont really interact with each other or have an influence on the world. They are just.. filler.If the price was half of what it is, Id highly recommend it. But this price seems to be for what the game appears to be and not what it actually is. If you have great imagination or need some inspiration for worldbuilding or not worried about the price, go for it. Really, its good. Otherwise depending on what you are looking for, there might be other games that are better. Hell during sale you can get entire Fallout 4 for cheaper. Subnautica if you want exploration-survival, Frostpunk if you want colony, Surviving Mars if you love Tech Trees. I also need to add that, there is this growing popularity of a new metric of measurement where people see the hours of entertainment a game provides. And honestly thats not a good metric. Spending 3 hrs playing Rimworld is not the same as spending 3 hrs watching DuneOppenheimer or swimming in a rented pool or watching TV. And on the same note 40 hours playing a beautiful linear story is worth much more than 100 spent in something like counter strike. People please stop encouraging this metric. I know we need to support the devs but this is  not the way. There is a growing trend of newer indie games being priced like AA games.  When the best thing about indie games apart from their innovation was their reasonable cost. kind of disappointed that some the basic feature are behind dlc unless your willing to drop 100 on this game The game developer clearly overvalues his DLCs and it feels like a rip-off. The game was never too expensive, despite never going on sales, so I was happy enough to purchase it at its full price. But then I saw the DLCs slowly get released, and each one just felt like it copied popular workshop mods I had been playing for free and suddenly wanted me to pay almost the same price as the original game! The DLCs all-together cost over 80 CAD - which is obscene! Thats more than the price of a triple-A game - and just for DLCs. This is, of course, an entirely personal opinion and I would probably change it if anything for Rimworld ever went on sale, but honestly I regret buying the base game now. Most of the mods I enjoyed are DLC-locked so I cant even appreciate the normal, non-DLC version.Terraria is a much more enjoyable game, and that goes on sale for 2.50 and doesnt force DLCs! Horse Armor truly was a mistake that broke gaming.  Rimworld is not worth paying over 120 for. I could buy 2-3 Triple-A games for that. I was told I should like this game if I liked Kenshi, I do not.The vanilla base game is way too slow and requires way too much micromanagement to be fun. Individual colonists lack personality and struggle to stand out, so when they die I just feel annoyed or indifferent. Loosing a colonist can cause a run to crawl to a halt while you wait for pawn with the right stats to enter the map, and that is assuming you dont accidentally kill them while trying to take them hostage.Despite this I cant stop playing, and am currently failing to overcome the sunk cost fallacy of having invested 60 hours in a single run. In the face of the overwhelmingly positive reviews this game has, I feel like I should like this game. Maybe if I find the right mods, or invest a not insignificant amount of money into the DLC, I will like the game? If I have to ask these questions, I cannot recommend that game. Do not buy for SteamDeck.Bought on steam deck as the game is listed Great on deck. It is not great on deck at all - I am sure the game is amazing with a mouse and big PC, on deck it is awful as there is no real controller support, just a cursor you control with the track pads - thats a crappy experience on deck and so this game is crappy to play on the deck. Sure its great elsewhere and I want to play it but... I only use the deck so... Rimworld  great game.My problem 35 for base game is a really, REALLY good deal, but it doesnt make sense for all the dlc to add up to 125 with the base game price, even just adding content that shouldve been a part of the base game. The game is good, fun even but it NEEDS to run on more than one core. Look, I love this game. I love the brutality of it, the story-telling aspect, I love to build my colony into a vast organ-stealing empire and raid and plunder my neighbors to my hearts content. I bought Rimworld originally on console, started a decent colony, had all nine colonists eaten alive by bunnies, and was immediately hooked. However, when I saw the difference between console and PC I was disappointed. I felt like I was limited severely with the no access to the newest DLCs and Mods. I bought the full package on PC and got started with Biotech, Ideology, Royalty, mods and started crazy playthroughs.HOWEVER, after starting many new colonies and downloading hundreds of mods with new flaura and fauna, game mechanics, etc, I started to notice that the quality of mods was equivalent to or better than the quality of content in the DLCs. Then I learned that a majority of the animals in Rimworld were originally made in a player submitted mod that was integrated into the full game by the devs after coming into agreement with the mod creators.At that point I started thinking about other mods in comparison to DLCs, particularly with biotech and child development, and I realized that a lot of the content in this game comes from the dev team looking to the modding community. Babies and children have been modded into this game for YEARS, but Biotech was only released fairly recently at a price of 30. Im not saying that the devs adding content from mods to the main game is a bad thing, I think its a great tool to keep the game healthy and fresh and introduce new ideas. However, I also think the problem here is that it feels like the community cares more about the quality of content in the game than the dev team. The devs let the community come up with cool new stuff and then they use that as inspiration to add new features in a paid 30 DLC. I think this game is great, I love creating colonies of sadistic organ-harvesting nudist cannibals, but I dont like spending money on content that has been in the modding community for years. I dont like the idea that in a year or two from now there might be a DLC that adds vehicle creation because that is one of the most popular mods available today. I think that this inspires a lack of effort from the devs to create new content or quality of life features which affects ALL platforms. I love this game, but I wont spend another dime on it. Great game until the pop up trying to force me into a legal contract a full year after purchase. If you bought this game DO NOT agree to the EULA, force a refund from the company or force them to pay you on the new terms of service that you force them to sign. DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO FORCE YOU. A legal agreement is made before not years later. Its taken me a while to write this review, because Ive been and still am split very much 5050 on whether to recommend this title, but on balance in the games current state unfortunately I cannot recommend it.Certainly there are some good things here, I have over 40 hours logged because the games world and mechanics are intriguing the graphics have a certain charm, they are more than adequate for a game like this, and it is set in an interesting and well thought out sci-fi world. Unfortunately I kept finding myself underwhelmed by the content and options that the game actually presented me with.I should state that I have played and enjoyed Dwarf Fortress, and I am a big fan of permadeath and Roguelikes in general - I have ascended in and even contributed to Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, which by the way is a free and awesome game so go download it now if you havent played it The problem for me with RimWorld is that while there is a really interested structure of a game here, that structure has not been fleshed out with enough meat. For something that has been in development for nearly 3 years this is quite worrying, especially with the apparent pace of updates released by the developer. I really do hope to eventually be able to change my review, what needs to change for that to happen is that the mechanics need to feel rounded out in the core game without relying on mods. Certainly there are mods available that fix many of my concerns with the current gameplay, but 23 is rather a lot for a title that then requires mods to turn it into something resembling a complete experience.Ill conclude this review by listing some specific things that I think badly need addressing going through this list it becomes apparent just how nearly every single mechanic in the game feels majorly lacking. Warning, some spoilers ahead, though they are very minor.1. Some bits of furniture can be uninstalled and moved to a different location, but it seems completely arbitrary which furniture this can apply to. It doesnt apply to workbenches, so if you want to move one a single square to the right you have to completely deconstruct it and rebuild it, wasting resources. There is a mod that makes them all movable. This mod simply switches some flags in the xml files, no more, so it would be incredibly easy for the devs to enable this like a 10 minute job and there doesnt seem to be any logical reason why they dont.2. Many of the workbenches have only a single option for what you can build. Would be nice to have a bit more variation, when the build queue for each bench technically alllows building many things of different types.3. Research is too expensive and makes much too big leaps. Would be nice to see a proper research tree with smaller increments of unlocking different builds, rather than typically unlocking an entire bench with all the things it can build. Weirdly there is one research option that unlocks a new type of seed to grow, but all the other seeds start unlocked. The research just overall seems bizarre. I can right now research among not many other things carpetmaking or ship antimatter reactor ... the latter only takes twice as much research as the former ... this just seems like not the right decision to be making.4. Not enough options for surgery and implants. I can harvest someones heart or kidney but not their limbs or their eyes. I can implant bionic legs, but I cant repair a broken spine. I cant construct these bionic implants myself. It seems like half the options there. Again there is a mod that provides a whole extra set of technologies to enable all this but it just feels the vanilla tech is unfinished.5. Variation of enemies. Particular the mechanoids, there are only two types. Surely mechanoids could be even more varied than humans or critters?6. GUI. There are all kinds of odd bugs and inconsistencies and awkwardness in the GUI. Sure its a massive improvement on DF but It really needs some love. There are also some basically usability things missing, for instance being able to compare the stats of two items or two characters side by side, or see a grid overview of the skills of all my colonists. When setting work priorities there is a grid where you have to hover over each cell to see the value of that specific skill, its really awkward.7. Combat. The sometimes continual raids that the storyteller throws at you get really tedious to defend, you have to micromanage every unit, which is really jarring next to the normal gameplay which is the antithesis of micromanagement. Combat should be set up by giving colonists rallying points or patrol areas, so during a raid they will all go to those locations. Take away direct control of the units, and make the raids a bit easier to compensate. This would much better fit the gameplay of a colony builder game and be a lot more fun. Currently the best way to defend against raids is to abuse gameplay mechanics and pathing logic to direct the enemies into killboxes, which to me feels like cheating. Things need tweaking A LOT to make these firefights enjoyable. Also if you have trained any pets then they will get immediately slaughtered, probably by friendly fire. You cant really mix melee and ranged combat at all because everyone even those with high shooting skill aims so badly they will just shoot your own melee dudes and pets instead of the enemy.8. Balance. The game is very hard, and switching to easier difficulties doesnt seem to change much. The storyteller AI basically decides when it wants you to die and there doesnt seem much that can be done about it. Apparently this is the point of the game. I would find these stories much more interesting if my colony had a chance to develop a bit further before inevitably getting decimated by overwhelming forces. It doesnt help that its extremely slow and difficult to recruit new colonists, so usually losing even one or two which is very likely to happen in any raid is a serious detriment to any progress. Maybe Im missing the point, but I was just not finding it enjoyable.9. Size of map, travelling to other sectors. The default map really isnt all that big, so resources are strictly finite. When you start the game you pick a spot on a huge world map but then you cant visit anywhere else on that map even though factions from elsewhere can visit you.Well ... I think those are all my biggest gripes, I could probably think of more, but this demonstrates the scale of the problem. I could see past one or two of these flaws because there is a really interesting game underneath struggling to get out, but with this many barriers to me enjoying it I just keep not wanting to carry on with my game. Im not sure how long it will take the devs to fix all of this, if they ever do, but we could be waiting another 3 years. This game is for a very specific type of person. I am not that person. It starts out fun, but quickly devolves into micromanagement hell. Micromanagement Early game there is a lot of variety and it can be fun and challenging responding to all of the random catastrophes, but very quickly you will start to get annoyed with how little autonomy your pawns the people in your colony actually have. They are dumb. Really really dumb. They have to be constantly monitored and managed and there is no easy way to make them do certain things. If they are starving for fun, you cant order them to play a game or go outside, instead you have to open a work schedule menu, set their schedule to recreation, then have them halt what they are doing multiple times. Why Ludeon, why? If you dont waste your time doing that then they will fly into a rage and insult all of your other colonists an effect that stacks, lasts for days, and can completely destroy that colonists mood, again, wtf Ludeon? or break your most expensive important machine. This is just nonsense. Components Another very annoying thing is that every important thing you build requires parts called components. Components cant be mfg until very late game so you have to get them from trading or, if youre lucky and they are on your map, mining. This is fine until no traders or trade ships come for an entire year or something else like that, during which time you are basically soft locked. Too weak technologically to leave your colony of braindead pawns to fend for itself while you travel, you just have to wait it out while you farm or do whatever else. You will learn that there are things you can do to make this less likely to happen, but the game may throw a wrench in your plans by striking down half your pawns with malaria or the plague as you attempt to do so. This can get very frustrating very quickly. Scaling difficulty with colony wealth Should you succeed in planning better and building nicer things, the game will punish you by massively increasing the size of the raids against your colony due to the colonys wealth increasing. This too is annoying since in order to have the colonists not throw tantrums they have to be in a good mood, and in order to be in a good mood they have to have nice things. This mechanic means that the simple act of replacing all your wood or dirt floors with sandstone tiles could add 2 to 3 more enemies on the next raid. You didnt get better guns. You didnt get better weapons or more colonists. All you did was add some nice floors to help your colonists not go crazy. I hate this mechanic. Overall, its not the worst game and I can see why people love it, but the lack of autonomy of the pawns, over-reliance on components, and scaling raids just for replacing your dirt floors with stone all combine to ruin it for me. It is a very good game but it is currently too expensive for the experience it offers, since many of the mods require you to own all the available DLC. Right now the full experience inclusive of all DLC is AU171. It is a great game but now that it is 50 and has nearly 100 in dlc a lot of which seems to be based on the mods, Im gonna have to now not recommend.Seems incredibly greedy. I wouldnt buy it again. The game can be really fun, but its way too expansive. The price for the DLCs are nuts. Pros- Challenging early to mid-game- Imaginative setting- Replay value- Addictive gameplay loopgrind- Interesting trade system.- Surgery and limb health system. You can organ harvest, replace limbs with bionics. This is probably my favourite part.Cons- Runs on one core, meaning massive FPS drops are certain.- Shallow diplomacy.- Slow. Too much Hurry up and wait, it gets boring.- Interface is clunky and unintuitive.- Once youve figured out the mechanics the magic is gone and winning is pretty simple.- There are no story events or anything to narratively spice things up.- Late-game is just dull.- Graphics are basically an animated doodle stuck on a proud parents fridge.- Expensive, especially the DLC- Gameplay has changed very little in eleven years.ConclusionAll in all this is just a colony simulator under the guise of a story creator. It kills some time and has its moments but the only thing that really makes it stand out is the ability to do quite horrible things to your colonists.Other than that I would say this game is propped up by mods that frequently get broken and a fanatical community fully committed to the sunk cost fallacy. If the price was reasonable that would be fine but as you can see the price is not reasonable. The developers greed and laziness continues to grow at an astonishing rate.Its up to you whether you pay the price demanded, I would not recommend it. There is simply no good reason for it. While Rimworld is fun and engaging, I feel it lacks content for its price especially the DLCs and often results in RNG standoffs between your dumb colonists and the even dumber raiders.It is incredibly addicting for the first couple hours however, it declines very quickly, devolving into micromanagement hell where colonists have to be practically manually controlled unable to do the most common tasks like eating, all the while the narrator throws random scenarios to build tension by killing your colonists one by one in increasingly unfair situations entire colony gets the plague, solar flare disables defences as 2000 point raid appears, colonist shoots another colonist in the head despite standing in front of them.I would not recommend Rimworld for any beginners or anyone on a budget, however, if you have 40 to waste  80 if you want the full game and not a demo, Rimworld is worth a shot.",
        "summary": "After about 50 hours of play, I never really encountered the content freedom that made my runs feel unique, like a generated story. There arent 100 bizarre plot twists that occur, like weird obelisks that mesmerize you or mysterious wanderers. On the other hand, the plot that does happen -- getting sick or a prisoner making a break for it -- sometimes seem silly for sillys sake."

        "text": "Id like to preface by saying Ive got 140 hours in the beta and roughly another 40 across EA play tests so my current hours are a little deceptive. Gun play is amazing, art style is beautiful, optimization is fantastic. In a market full of saturated tactical shooters FragPunk is one of the few that are taking an overused formula and adding an original spin with the card system. The best way I could explain the game is its a tactical shooter with rogue-lite elements where every round, every game, and every run feels different. I think this game has nailed launch with the amount of content it has released with and Im looking forward to where the game goes in the following monthsyears. I see an excessive amount of complaining about the micro-transactions but its clear the people here just dont realize the state of the game industry. A free-to-play title can not launch or even sustain without money. Id also like to add, the micro transactions in this game while are large in quantity, theyre also great in quality and are incredibly fair priced compared to its competitors such as Apex, Valorant, and Siege. The game is completely free and NOTHING is purchasable that will give you a competitive advantage in the slightest. It is PURELY cosmetic. There has been so much love put into this game from its passionate developers and if micro-transactions are the reason you dont even try it, studios will continue to fall like dominoes. Fantastic game, amazing potential for its future in both a casual and competitive environment, Solid 910 as beta tester of this game i am still amazed, love the gunplay, artstyle, multiple gamemodes. there is some little thinks that are not the same movement is slower but is not that big deal, i am sure devs will tweak it, menus are a little confusing but its easy to learn them and even biggest complain i saw multiple currencies are not that bad as people talk. game is super fan shooter, cards make it unique and every round in match is different.game is free and all need to try it, u have nothing to lose. its fun and new stuff in competitive shooters and i think that is main sale point for me it can be very competitive but most important is that is fun The game is really fun to play, with satisfying gunplay and shard cards that can change the entire gameplay experience and great character design. Besides 5v5 mode, there are some other modes worth checking, such as Duel 1v1, TDM, Kill Confirm, Outbreak, etc. Ive played the beta and loved the games gunplay and vibe. Ive eagerly waited for the games launch. Now its here, some changes Ive seen like movement is slightly slower and they have multiple currencies now, but the gunplay and animation are great. For those who dont know, its like a hero shooter like CS or Valorant. The only difference is the gunplay and movement, which is like COD or Battlefield, which I usually prefer for casual play. In short, Great game and they have a decent monetization, but I would like them to give the character unlock currency more every round, right now you need to grind very hard to unlock characters. Apart from that, BAD GUITARS are under Netease games, which developed Marvel Rivals, which I love. Marvel Rivals had great monetization, so I have great hope for this game as well. This scratches my competitive itch very well, like CS2. Dont know why its said Mixed review, its a good game which has good optimization in the year 2025, where every paid game is an Alpha build to be tested by the user. Game is fun. Nobody forces you to buy skins. I want to address many of the problems that people are leaving negative reviews for.1. People complaining there is too many in game currencies - Sure i get how at first it can be overwhelming or confusing, however the excuses people are giving of its monetising everything or trying to make money out of anything is absolutely ridiculous. There is ONE currency that you can actually BUY with real money, the rest are simply achieved through playing the game. In my opinion there is 0 reason to complain about a game offering you many free avenues to get skins, new characters and more, imo a BS take that people who simply dont understand the game complain about. 2. Weapons are unbalanced - In my opinion this is one of the most balanced games ive played PERIOD. Unlike games like CS, Valorant OR Siege where headshots are a 1 tap this game it only increases the damage for majority of weapons, only marksmans at close range and snipers at any range are a 1 shot headshot. The TTK in Fragpunk is very spot on.3. Duels being a stupid OT system - In my opinion this does 2 GOOD things for the game. 1. It makes the overtime far more intense, causing for a very cool way to end the game. 2. Doesnt rely on potentially defenseattack sided maps hoping that you get the better side on the last round, and puts it down to straight 1v1 gun skill.Overall Fragpunk is a very good shooter in my opinion which if they continue to expand on the map pool, card selections, nerfbuff certain cards, and overall listen to the community, im sure it is a game that will be around for a while. Probably most fun new shooter Ive tried in years. Gunplay is tight, Lancers are cool and maps are mostly nice. Shard cards both tie it all together and mix up things for the kinds of play variation you wouldnt see in any of established franchises. Heres wishing they can support this foundation well over time to make it even more of a success. The game is highly enjoyable and offers a wide selection of characters to choose from, which adds to its appeal. However, becoming skilled at the game does require a significant time investment. On the positive side, the game is well-optimized, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience. That said, the reward system feels a bit disorganized and cluttered within the UI. It could benefit from being simplified, as the current setup can feel overwhelming and spammy on the screen. Overall, despite this minor drawback, the game is fantastic and definitely worth playing. While the micro-transactions are absolutely abhorrent, the actual gameplay is quite fun and all the micro-transactions for the most part are just cosmetics so IMO its competently fine. Imagine booting up a game in 2025 day one, and being faced with an incredibly polished experience. Crazy right?! The game looks great, It plays great, and its a ton of fun. If your a fan of AttackDefend games this is definitely worth giving a shot! FragPunk  A Hero Shooter That Finally Feels Fresh  After playing the CBT and now the full release, I can confidently say FragPunk is the unique hero shooter Ive been waiting for. Fast-paced action? Check. Strategy? Check. Shard Cards that change the game every round? BIG CHECK.   A New Take on Hero Shooters  Ive been bored of the usual plant-and-defuse modes seriously, how many more Search  Destroy clones do we need?. This game actually delivers something different. Every match feels fresh, and the Shard Card system adds a layer of strategy that keeps me hooked.   The Movement Feels Different?  A lot of players, including me, feel that the movement is different from the CBT. Its not a dealbreaker, but I hope the devs tweak it because I know they actually listen to the community. Theyve been running awesome community events, and that kind of engagement deserves praise.   Skins, Currencies, and the Economy Debate  Some people are mad about the multiple currencies, but skins are optional yes, your aim stays the same even with a 50 skin. The game even gives   from events, so complaining about paid cosmetics feels unnecessary. Grinding for the Lancer takes time, but honestly, it makes unlocking it more satisfying. In the meantime, I get to master different Lancers instead of just chasing the next unlock. Art, Characters, and Optimization  The character design, art style, and overall vibe of this game are chefs kiss. Everything looks so unique, and best of all, it runs smoothly even on my laptop without sacrificing visuals. A rare combo these days.   Final Thoughts      A fresh take on hero shooters with an actual unique mode.    The Shard Card system keeps every match interesting.  The art style is stunning and feels unique. - Movement feels different from CBT devs, we believe in you . - Grinding for Lancers takes time but hey, its rewarding. - Too many currencies. I just want to buy something without feeling like I need a financial advisor.  FragPunk is fun, unique, and full of potential. It just needs some movement tweaks, but Im here for the ride.  TWIST Threw a Shard Card to counter the enemy turns out, it buffed them instead.1010  Would assist the enemy team again. Originally reviewed this at launch saying another W for China, but that didnt do Fragpunk justice.Fragpunk is the perfect arena FPS for CoD kids who could never get good at CSGO or Valorant. All the characters are fun and valuable in coordinated play, animations and skins are dope, and as long as players keep paying for gacha skins its a Chinese game after all, this game will have endless content.Like many others, I dont want to see it die. My CoD habits always held me back from games like Valorant, but this feels like the fresh middle ground Ive needed. If that sounds like you, give it a try. I am genuinely enjoying this game. It feels refreshing and not like its a copy of any other 5v5 hero shooter.the criticism this game is getting is also not warranted IMO.You may here there are 9 currencies, and while true in the grand scheme of things, its not quite like that.There are 3 main currencies, and only one of which can be purchased with real money. The other two can be earned completely by playing. There is even a feature that generates you those two currencies while offline.The one paid currency is the basic paid currency that you can buy and spend on cosmetics.Side note, no cosmetics are P2W either, as there are individual settings for you to hide your cosmetics from either your team andor the enemy team.The remaining currencies are event currencies. You can get whats called Porcelain Shards from completing challenges, and use them to get Porcelain Skins for your weapons. There are ranked tokens aswell, which you earn by playing ranked and can spend on say a gold camo for your AR if youve reached gold rank.Theyre not as prominant and in your face as people make it seem.If youre not sure about the game, try it.Its free, and you dont need to spend money on anything. After getting burnt out on FPS games thousands of hours this game reignited the fun with its intuitive and unique shard system, making every single round play different. There is a card that lets you visually rip off your health bar to throw it at enemies or teammates lol to swap health Keeping track of the enemies card and counter-playing them is a game itself.Compared to the two popular games CS and Valorant, FragPunk feels like a next-gen game with its performance, amazing gun-play, creative abilities and letting you place stickers which you can earn for free ANYWHERE on your gun as well as kill counters and charms. Did i mention you can place stickers on your team-mates mid-match?This game prioritises fun over the illusion of balance which many games try to achieve but instead sacrifice creativity in the process.The many challenges, events and over-bloated menus can be daunting at first but are a non-issue after having played a bit.Simply hitting the R button lets you claim everything automatically..The Monetisation is incredibly generous and despite all the crazy abilities and cards the game feels fairly balancedThe Negatives- Lacking voice-lines Hearing the same voice-line for the 100th time gets annoying as fuck- Chinese companies have bad reputation despite the game being god-tier- You are not playing the game A breathe of fresh air for the casual gamer. I ACTUALLY have fun playing either competitive or casual. I keep seeing whiners bitch and complain which is the only reason Im writing this. 2.5 hours in game to write a negative review because you suck ass Isnt the games fault. If you suck just say so. Monetization exists and can seem predatory but what F2P isnt. Game i must pay its employees and server somehow. If you dont want to buy something, Dont Simple as that. As for AI art, i havent noticed any and Im pretty sure its just to slander the game. IF AI is used i still dont notice it because the game is fun enough that i just done care. IF AI art bothers you as a Chinese made game then you might want to reevaluate somethings. The menu UI is the only thing that bothers me because of how eastern it seems. Which again i think People like me from the west dont entirely understand it because its New.TLDR Game is fun for both the casual audience and the competitive audience, people slander the game who have 0 playtime. Game is free,play for yourself and come up with your own opinion. Hell yeah brother, this game rocks its a less sweaty version of valorant or Cs with waaaay more fun gunplay and mechanics. The only few negatives I have arent gameplay related though there are 1 or 2 things there too its not gamebreaking really. The time to unlock a new lancer even if do all the challanges quickly is too long gold accumulation is to slow or the price per lancer too high. The other big thing is the Menu itself it just has to much thrown into it and is overall not really easily maneuverable. But besides these things Fragpunk is amazing and just straight up fun unlike all the other comp shooters. This game is so much fun, the gunplay is a mix between CSValo to COD when you ADSThe cards add stratigic depth and the weapon and lancer system work really well both in strategy decisions as well as card system.Some maps are a bit Defender sided  and feel clastrophobicSome cards need to be removed from comp and some need to be removed entirely Some balances fixes are needed But the same as any game nothing is perfect and especially on release, I believe those issues will be resolved with time and feedback but overall its so much fun.I played 60 Hours on Beta and 45 since release I truly believe the devs listen to community and I know they play their own game which is rare this days.Thank you for a great experience! Super well optimized, really fun and unique modifiers, genuinely fun game. Primarily leaving a positive review because the game is awesome, though it has its flaws at launch. Really, the only negatives are the monetization system purely cosmetic so whatever, and the fact that it was delayed for console. Im sure there are some things out of control, and for that reason I want to prevent this game from getting review bombed unjustly. Give it a try if youre like me and get too bored with the repetitiveness of CSGO and Valorant. 10 hours in and having a blast so far!! Ill update the review if I feel otherwise. It has been a long time since a FPS or even multiplayer game in general has caught my attention this well and has had me playing for hours upon hours with no break. It came out as a FINISHED game. No massive bugs, no massive glitches, a plethora of content on launch and a LOT to unlock. Speaking of unlocking, the only downside is you get 5 characters off the rip that are free, the rest you either have to grind to unlock, pay for which they appear to be roughly 5 dollars a piece, or you can pay for the monthly subscription that is 10 dollars and gives you the battlepass, all the characters as long as you are subscribed, 10 dollars of the paid currency, and some other goodies every month. For free to play players it is frustrating and I think they should bring the price of characters down just a little bit for the free currency! But in its current state even if I did not pay for the monthly goodies, I would still play to unlock them. The game itself even if you dont have all the characters is insanely fun. As I said its a polished and well thought out game, they really knocked it out of the park. The card system is very fun and innovative. Instead of basic things like adding some health or some damage or even like a bonus to move speed which are all still cards in some way or another There are also really fun GAME CHANGING cards that will make no match feel the same! Things like changing how the entire map plays for a round i.e removing a site, adding a site, or making it grassy or snowy, or even just making everyone fight with knives for a round! The characters all feel balanced and I have not seen one dominate and they all seem fun so you can pick who interests you and know youre not going to just lose because its not meta. The cosmetics are fairly priced and for this good of a product, I genuinely do not mind giving the developers some money, they really deserve it in my opinion. If you enjoy CSValorant and want a new game to mix it up a little bit, I cannot recommend this game more! Really fun game but the menu is crazy.Theres 3 primary currencys Gold, Gluntie,  Frapunk CoinsGold is a free currency mostly for new characters, but can also be used for sticker fusion.Glunite is a free currency for some of the cosmetics from the gun or lancer customisation menu.Fragpunk Coins are your premium currency and are used for most every other cosmetic.But wait theres moreUltimate Materials are a reward for the gatcha system that lets you buy from that prize pool.Membership pick are a currency you get each month to pick a exclusive membership skin.Battlepass tokens are a reward for once you have been the battlepass that can be traded for more stuff.Ranked tokens are a reward for playing ranked to pick up special gun skins.Club Supplies are a reward for playing with friends and used for more free stuff.We have 7 free currencies and 1 premium currency that are staples of the games shop system.This doesnt include the fact there are consumables that you can get that are used for gatcha pulls which is like a currency in its own right but Im going to choose to think of them as closer to loot boxes themselves.Dont worry we have more to get to, when it comes to Events we haveProcelain Shards which are free for doing challenges and can we converted to gun skins and can get you a Lancer.Thats the 9 currencies but we also have progression paths to look at too.Permanent Progression PathsRefer A Friend gets you a Nitro Hat.Each Lancer has a progression path.Each Gun has a progression path.Leveling up has a progression path.Limited Time Progression PathsLog in Rewards get you a lancer, emote, and a melee weapon skin.Chum challenges you earns you chum specific cosmetics and more.Battle frenzy rewards you for trying new modes and give you more stuff.Level Up rewards you for hitting level milestones during the Limited Time window.Shopping Season Sales gives you gatcha for what you spend in the game.Construction gives you more supplies and such at the end of the event for buying and spending Fragpunk coins.Ranked sprint rewards you for hitting lvl 30 and playing ranked.The game also has a limited time bonus and one time purchase reward for fragpunk coins.Oh and you have an imp who farms gold over time and obviously the battlepass and membership exist.The game has so many events going on and so many different progression systems most of which are free and can be ignored til you see the present icon but overall results in a very overwhelming store experience.If they hid the shops til they mattered to you it would make it alot easier for people to get a hang of.No club no club tab, no battlepass then you dont need to see the shop that comes after its done.Also they probably could have staggered some of these limited time events out so that we only had say 3 at a time rather then like 6. Also if they cleaned up the events pages a bit, we dont need to see the shop items in there or see a game mode itself, plus they will show you an event on one tab you click it and it just goes over one page. I think if we showed each thing once and staggered the introducion  it would result is a less confusing experience.",
        "summary": "Fantastic game, amazing potential for its future in both a casual and competitive environment. Solid 910 as beta tester of this game i am still amazed, love the gunplay, artstyle, multiple gamemodes. Game is really fun to play, with satisfying gunplay and shard cards that can change the entire gameplay experience."

        "text": "Its the same re branded formula made to only sell skin. I appreciate the effort of trying to add new feature to the already existing game format has been for ages, but when you see that everything already has 10 skin and that there is 9 CURRENCIES, you know what the intentions behind this game are. I wont even talk about gacha lord help me. The game feels jankie, everything is so slow in an environment where you would think that it should be fast and explosive. Even the game dont know what it should be between a fast action fps and a tactical shooter.TLDR Imagine if borderland, cyberpunk, and valorant were cousins and had a baby. The gameplay is quite fun, but the game itself is overloaded with so many microtransactions that it would make EA blush. Ive seen exploitative mobile games with less egregious monetization.Featuring     Multiple shops     Arbitrary pricing of the premium currency including first-time purchase bonuses     3-tiered battlepasses free, premium, and extra premium     Gacha banners     Too many currencies to keep track of     2 types of Lootboxes which also double as a currency for the gacha banners     Convoluted pricing for premium items     And last but definitely not least A premium monthly membership, with a complementary exclusive gacha banner if you buy the annual version Game is very unstable on the connection side, having 300ms of latency is common on that game and it shouldnt. I play alot of Valorant, CS2 and plenty of games that require access to good internet, which I have and I have never seen worse than Fragpunk, yeah the game is cool and all, but why wont they let me enjoy it? Why does it want me to install a garbage software to make my connection better? Seriously? Honestly if you just wanted to scam your players just say so.. I wouldnt mind 100ms, but going from 30 to 300 to 500 in a matter of a second is a game breaker for me. I never leave a review but here it is. This is the biggest piece of shit rage inducing chinese slop ware fucking kernel level anti cheat gatcha fucking slop Ive ever played. Worst ranked of any game Ive ever played. Insane sbmm, cheaters galore, worst degenerate teamates Ive ever had the misfortune of wasting my time on. Do yourself a huge favour and never touch this piece of shit game. They took something good, and they threw it away. Every form of micro-transaction. slow progression towards unlocking characters rough math approx. 35 hours for ONE character. season pass, loot-boxes, 9 currencies, it has it all. If you played the beta, save your time - its not what it was. 9 currencies even in a f2p game is crazy. gocha mechanics payed sub service cost over 108 a year even with there discount is crazy everything is way over priced and the chars take way way to long to earn even fairly you only ear 200 ish gold a match and you need over 18k to unlocked just 1 char moment feels like your running in quick sand. and this sucks because the game is fun the chars gunplay,  mechanics, and cards. All in all the got to earn the trust and respect of the players and this is a cash grab in full even Halo had to walk it back and look box random garbage does not belong in games as a paid system. im only putting this a negative bcs of the movement, tbh the beta was more fun and now it feels slow and clunky, monetization is not a problem with me since i choose not to buy anything but i do feel like the game is unbalanced? i guess? idk it could be skill issue coming from me-, but the beta was amazing, i just feel so... underwhelmed by this, maybe if a few updates go by it could be better but we will see. The game is good dont get me wrong just feel like some adjustments Gunplay feels good, but company uses EOMM to rig the matches to ensure you keep playing and spending money. None of the matches are fair, theyre just designed to milk you dry. Screw this game. A Fresh Take with Rough EdgesFragPunk is a game that brings a fresh and exciting experience to the hero shooter genre. From the moment you jump in, the art style stands outits vibrant, stylish, and gives most characters distinct personalities. However, some characters feel unpolished or out of place, as if they were rushed or didnt get the same level of design care. Gameplay  Balance The weapons are unique and fun, each with its own flair, but the balancing feels off. For example, its frustrating to lose a long-range fight to an SMG at 20 meters because my sniper cant one-shot, but the SMG can mag-dump me instantly. These imbalances need fine-tuning to prevent frustration and keep engagements fair.The preparation phase is too fast, making it hard to set up strategies and abilities before the action starts. Players dont have enough time to position themselves or execute proper tactics, which takes away from the depth of the game. Round Pace  Gun Economy Fragpunks lack of a proper gun economy severely impacts the games pacing and strategic depth. Since weapons are essentially free, theres no incentive to manage resources, make careful buying decisions, or adapt based on previous rounds. Players can instantly pick up high-powered weapons like snipers from the very first round, and even after losing multiple rounds, they still have access to the same firepower. This removes any real comeback mechanics or tactical progression, making each round feel isolated rather than part of a larger battle. The absence of a dedicated pistol round further flattens the experience, as theres no structured buildupjust an immediate jump into full-loadout fights with no real stakes.Maps  UIThe maps look good but feel like they lack a strong identitynone of them stand out as truly memorable. They function well but dont have the distinct themes or layouts that could make them iconic.The UI is a mixed bag. In-game, its clean and visually appealing, but the menu UI is a messtoo many elements are scattered around, making navigation cluttered and unintuitive. This is something that can be improved over time, but right now, its frustrating to deal with.Sound  GraphicsThe game excels in sound design and graphics. The audio is crisp, and the visuals feel polished, making gunfights satisfying and immersive.Bugs  IssuesUnfortunately, Ive run into some frustrating bugs. One of the worst is during duel phases, where the game crashes after picking a character. This kind of bug can be a dealbreaker in competitive play and needs to be fixed ASAP.Monetization  Shop IssuesThe shop is confusingthe pricing numbers dont follow rounded values, making everything feel off. The gacha system is predatory the cosmetics it offers are low quality for the price, and unless youre lucky enough to pull the knife which has a 1 drop rate after building up a pity of 50, youre basically getting scammed.The battle pass feels like a low-effort, Chinese cash grab. The skins, especially the recolors, are uninspired, and they lack proper physics and polish. A good battle pass should have a strong theme and offer worthwhile rewards, not a mix of random, low-quality cosmetics with no cohesion. Right now, it feels cheap and out of place.Final ThoughtsFragPunk has a lot of potential, but it needs to overcome multiple hurdles. The core gameplay is fun, the art style is fantastic, and the sound design is solid, but issues like weapon balance, UI clutter, poor monetization, and frustrating bugs hold it back. If the developers listen to feedback and make meaningful improvements, this game could stand out in the genre.Right now, its a fun experience with a lot of rough edges, but its too early to tell if it will thrive or crash under its own flaws. the game is the closest thing to sex ive experienced and its such a unique game BUT.9 currencies is jus too much and 20k for a character...the biggest problem tho is the movement, in the beta it felt fast and smooth now its jus WAY too slow like zeus dropped his balls on ur forehead and told u RUN. u cant even do the typo strafes u could in the beta. PLEASE FIX THISSSSSS would probably be fun if it werent for the frequent lag spikes. No other game lags nearly this badly for me Fragpunk is kind of a weird beast where the games presentation and actual gameplay mechanics cant clash in a more drastic way. This is genuinely one of the most innovative pvp shooters Ive played in years, in which the round-based Search and Destroy game mode mixed with your, on paper, stale hero shooter framework. But now its not just a bunch of guns and abilities, there are also modifier cards that give direct advantages and manipulate the playground in some bizarre ways that just scream screw balance, lets have fun. They range from giving everyone on the defense team a defuser, letting everyone pick the same heroes, to spawning a grim reaper that murks enemy campers and growing grass to the whole map so everyone can touch I mean hide inside bushes and stay invisible. The gimmick is wholeheartedly playful and result in either fun counterplays or mix ups that let players turn the whole match around, as the game isnt purely dominated by players who are too good at gunplay though you still need gun skill to win consistently nor too relying on stale heroes team ups. It feels like some madman too obsessed with Titanfalls burn cards mechanic and decided to build a competitive game around them, but the result is a competitive environment that varies through each matches and rounds, pesky tactics based on modifier choices just have as much impact as raw skills, and some ideas adapted from other games like the team duels based on Warzones Gulag work incredibly well with Fragpunks own flavors. From outside, you might find the bland but highly energetic and colorful comic book inspired aesthetic and character designs straight out of a typical Korean MMO imply a hectic fast paced shooter, but in reality Fragpunk is an actual thinking man shooter, one that is willing to embrace creativity.So why the thumb down? Because I cant in good conscience recommend Fragpunk purely based on the rest of the game. Turns out the cards arent the only chaotic part of the game, but also the absolutely abhorrent amount of dark pattern tactics the developers managed to jam into what could have been just a fun pvp shooter. The game doesnt just have a cash shop and a battle pass, but also gacha draws, daily login, a little goblin that spits out gold if you let it build up energy in a specific timeframe, yearly membership, a plethora of different in-game currencies, challenge screens, and events that genuinely can give a normal person a migraine because everything is accompanied by all these dubsteps, progression bars, new item red dot notifications and fancy animations. The metagame part of Fragpunk feels like an overengineered mess. You just cant finish a match and see the result screen in peace, the game immediately bombards you with 3816 different earned rewards and completed challenges. Advertising pop-ups and submenus murder your sense the moment you login. Sometimes you dont even get direct rewards for doing stuff in matches, you get packs of items and you have to unpack them for more items, often irrelevant crap like stickers which can be shoved into some kind of fusion mechanic so you can get more stickers. You can buy a new skin for a gun, you can also recolor that skin provided that you have a specific amount of currency dedicated to just recoloring the gun. And its difficult to not engage with all this mess either this hero shooter that release in 2025 doesnt even unlock all heroes from the beginning! - you have to grind 18888 units of an earnable currency why the specific amount?, buy them with real money, or get some unlock tokens from daily login and event rewards - which are easily the fastest way to unlock heroes. This is where my love for Fragpunk sinks to the bottom of the Earths core. This is the first shooter where I genuinely dont want to win matches, I just want to enjoy like 15 consecutive rounds where the map turned snowy, everyone got big heads, the game turned into melee only, our shotguns received dragons breath, we have a cute little demon following us and explode nearby enemies. I dread whenever the match ends, the game suddenly becomes a damn slot machine in presentation that utilizes every single tactics in the instant gratification playbook. Colors, pop up animations, exclamation points, progression bars, it vomits brain simulating beats every 2 seconds and doesnt let your senses rest. Its genuinely concerning that Infinity Nikki - a literal gacha game, has less predatory presentation than this supposedly competitive FPS where nothing is P2W. Its never that simple, and its a genuine shame that this happened to one hell of a creative breath of fresh air like Fragpunk. I very rarely do reviews. But I have to do one here. I dont have much time to play at the moment and often when I had time to play, the servers were down around 90 of my playtime was the very first weekend. Which is a big -point. But the fact that they are now changing things like movement speed after the release is not good. It changes all the timings and the way you have to aim. And I dont have the time to relearn that now, which is the reason why im gonna play the game much less or maybe stop playing it altogether. After playing the BETA it looked very promising but after the official release it was worse? Its a very boring, CT sided, camping with sniper game.Theres really only 2-3 strong characters and they always get insta locked. Broken abilitys such as teleporting someone from nade impact in front of you there is almost 0 chance you can avoid that just to get a knife through you, no counter. The maps we see who were also in the beta are kinda ok but the new map is just complete garbage, 1 choke point on each side and like the whole game super CT sided... low chance of getting inside site let alone surviving it.Ranking system is completely busted. You win all 5 placements? You are now Plat5! In the middle of the ranking system. Lose a game? -10RP or even -0RP because of a random rank protection? You win? There you go, big fat 30RP increase, well done Platinum and diamond are now flooded with players who do not even know how doors work and are overall just not doing anything because its not their level yet, going 17 KD and enraging other teammates.Overall not a recommendation although i invested in the pre-order bundle. This game is super unpolished and has many cheap problems which seem easy to fix but are still in the game from the beta. Not worth your time, sanity and effort. I was originally really excited for this game after playing the beta, but upon the games launch, I realized this was just like a girls only fans account, microtransactions one after another, making this game feel like a mobile game. And dont even get started on the 300 flipping menus where its a gamble if youre going to get to where you want to go. Was really excited for this when i played beta, however on full release, it feels almost exactly like valorant and thats a bummer. Theres no real tactic involved, virtually any gun can result in a one-shot. The Time-to-kill is far too short and ranges for some weapons are still ludicrous, in no universe should a shotgun or smg one-tap anyone from full health at range. -devs i get you want it to be fast paced but you can do that without making every gun capable of instant kill. in beta average body hit was 4-5 hit to kill, now its just 3 or less regardless of weapon or one-tap head basically no matter whathead shot is understandable in most casesoverall the ranges need to be tweaked for close-quarter weapons and should tweak limbbody dmg.where its at, theres really very little use for skills at all, i can go rounds upon rounds with out having to use skills ever, where is the fun or point in that?meh 310-2 star rating. doesnt stand out much anymore. I love how original and fresh the gameplay can be. however there are so many greedy glaring issues that right now I would not recommend buying anything as I feel this could very well be another XDefiant. This monetization scheme is so horrible that it feels more like a shopping mall with an fps minigame. Even Satan, Lucifer, The god of the underworld would not implement this kind of monetization in hell. Beta used to be the best multiplayer game ive ever played in my life. Now its full with so much slop its insane. 9 different currencies, slow character progression, ruined movement, 2 different battle pass tiers, micro-transactions around every click, and on top of all that, 2 different forms of gambling. what happened bro 3 I like the game a lot, but damn is the TDM maps poorly designed The game also just doesnt feel as nice with the slower movement speeds. Should have just nerfed jumping accuracy. Not move speed. Game is solid but it has a lot of glaring issues. First is servers. I live in the center of US and my lowest ping game has been 65ms. I have yet to see anyone below 50 in any lobby. Second is no aim assist despite having a toggle for it in the setting? Is it a bug or did they decide to get rid of it completely? No communication on that front at all. Audio is also a big issue that I dont have in any other game. Footsteps are extremely loud but you cant tell whether they are in front ,behind, or right beside you!!! The footsteps sound the exact same whether they are 50ft away or right behind you! Very very frustrating experience so far. Core gameplay is solid though but a lot of problems",

        "text": "In a land a long, long time ago, Team Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter. Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly a decade ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs arent defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You wont find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like its nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although theres some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience nearly every time you play. Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day. They removed the Bots as of July 1. I still suck at this game but at least they removed them. Once you start, there is no coming back.You can only take really long breaks, but you will never actually stop playing the game. One of the few games that outlived its community. The moment you enter the game you are transported back to a time, unhurt and in pristine condition. a time-capsule of enjoyment by every metric. The memes, lingo, hats, characters, cinematics, voice-lines, guns, cosmetics, maps, updates, art-style and the music, every single thing TF2 has produced is known by all, seen by all, played by all. Whereas games of the same nature keep degrading, TF2 is still alive and well. Thank you Valve. jungle what now? the crate depression? bot crisis? no updates in years?wow dude you mustve hit your head hard now come on! love and war just dropped and were all having a conga party! 4 thousand hours sunk into it. Its a great game and i wish i could have experienced it around 2009 to 2015 at its golden age. It may not be the golden age but i will still be playing as long as the servers are open. 20 anniversary is approaching and i cannot wait to see what they come up with. Im an old player. Ive played for around 1000 hours since 2016. Im not that old but i have very fond memories of TF2. I was very young back then. Valve has made something unique, something that is almost akin to a rite of passage for a proper gamer. Its one of the few games that still lets you do almost anything you want, for better or for worse. I am so happy and proud to have been part of the community. Its the most dedicated one i have ever witnessed, most likely on par with the communities of Lord of the Rings and the like. Valve used to care about the game, and Gaben himself did, once. Even if they dont now, you can see it in its soul that it has love baked into the code itself. Play tf2. And you wont be able to play anything else for a while. For me, it was 7 years until i was done. But the youtube videos, the sfms, the meet the team.... THEY show what tf2 is about. The community. I personally seriously got into tf2 when i saw meet the pyro, late 2015. Team Fortress 2 is, in a nutshell, a team-based FPS in which the Red and Blue team compete against each other with 9 different classes in various game modes.PROS Free to play  Many maps, gamemodes and tons and tons of weaponry and cosmetics, both official and community-made Very beginner-friendly. Unlike games like CSGO, new players have a very fair chance of beating even experienced players You will get weekly drops of weapons sometimes cosmetics too A huge interest in trading items via a network of trading servers and sites. Skilled traders can make profit in the form of real money as well Tons of alternate gamemode servers like x10, randomizer, medieval, deathruns, surfing, jumping, trading, tons of workshop maps, etc.   It depends if you consider this as a pro, but theres explosivejumping. Its so incredibly fun and theres over 500 downloadable jumpmaps and an active community behind it. At least a fifth of my hours in this game are spent on explosivejumping TF2 uses the Source engine, a very comfortable engine and very easy to configure and save settings with  Trading cards CONS - The community can be kind of toxic andor cringy at times- Valve keeps adding more and more updates people generally dont enjoy - If you play TF2 now, youll play with a lot of weapons that used to be different usually better in the past. Occasionally weapons get re-balanced and often break because of itEver wondered why people who play Valve games have so many hours in their games? Because most Valve games are solid and super enjoyable games that withstand the test of time theyre always classic and fun. Team Fortress 2 has been around for over a decade and yet its popularity is still up there with other top selling games.Ive played this game for years, mainly because its such a casual game in which you can hop on nearly any server and just play without any sort of startup or gathering of resources required beforehand. Same goes for quitting said server.This is a game you just keep on getting back at. Its too brilliant not to play, in all honesty.P.S. Just a tip, play on community servers. Ive never played matchmaking or competitive because its just boring compared to the fun youll get on various casual servers. Play it vanilla. Its easily one of the best FPS games ever made.Every character has its own personality  charm,Graphics are almost timeless.Gunplay  movement is top tier.Also it has goofy cosmetics. Great game. Its always there, even when you get sick of it, youre still able to come back to it later. Ive had lots of enjoyment with TF2 and the community is a huge part of the reason its so magnificent. Sadly Valve doesnt help the TF2 devs too much, so the updates are VERY slow, but 90 of the time when they DO come, theyre wonderful. Overall its a great game if you love FPSs with a bit of a twist. Its not your average COD game obviously but it does still have the core aspects of an FPS class-based system. The DLC or essentially battle passes are the only thing that cost money here, but even then you can do very well without, theyre more of just an added bonus, as they dont give you any competitive advantage over other players. There are hundreds of cosmetics for your different classes but of course those are optional. TF2 is a great way to get into Steam tradingmarketing too!  Definitely recommend, at least giving it a try. Its free so why not? 4079h of playtime, at the time of this review.  Damn. How to review a 10 years old game?   PROSThe balance. You can enter in this game and actually play with the stock basic weapons of each class and youll not be in disadvantage. Every weapon has its ups and downs in the most variety of situations. Its hard to find a multiplayer game with this kind of balance. 9 great classes. Can you think on a 10th class? In my opinion this game managed to get all playing forms into 9 different classes,  each one unique,  each one with its ups and downs,  just like the weapons. Once again,  great balance. Game modes. Youll have a bunch of different game modes to play.  Capture points, payload, payload race, king of the hill,  capture the flag,  and so many more,  even in community servers..  Theres everything. You can even play freakin hide n seek. Microtransactions done right.  Everything you can buy in-game doesnt give you any advantage while playing.  You can either get tools, cosmetic items or weapons which,  as said before, will not get the game unfair.  True F2P,  and not P2W. Variety of weapons,  maps and cosmetics. This game has everything. Competitive and casual gaming included.  Seasonal events. Halloween, Christmas,  etc,  gets you special gaming period with game modifications. Halloween is great! 10 years of updates and counting.  How many games get this support? Humor. Voice lines are awesome. And taunts. Just awesome. TF2 Economy.  This game has its own economy and it was one of the first games that introduced trading system. Maybe it was the first? Its F2P!  Try it!  CONS - Weapons nerfs and buffs. Over the years we had changes in the weapons.  Some were need.. Others not so much. And some are still needed to this day. Its not easy,  but the weapons could have a better analysis in this topic,  I think. - Bugs after big updates. My years  of experiencing this game showed me that after a big update comes a roll of problems,  usually resolved after a small period of...  Days? -  Too many items. The game got to a point where there are so many,  so many,  but sooo many items... Dont get me wrong,  its cool to have items but..  Kinda exagerating now? So many crates with so much cosmetic items..-Reskin weapons.  Weapons with same stats of others..  But reskined? Id prefer that each weapon had unique stats.  And this comes all the way back from the first years of the game.   OVERALL 9.810 -   The game of a lifetime I mean, I dont know where to start with this game. Best game I have ever played out of the couple hundred games I have tried. And a quite interesting one too! I am surprised that this game has survived this long, while Fortnite cant survive a week without an update. By all I MEAN all. Toxicity, constant cheaters and bots, lack of communication, but yet.... its still strong. I HIGHLY recommend this game, its still fun and has a wonderful and goofy experience for competitive and casual players alike.

Ubisoft returned to Steam. EA returned to Steam. Activision came to Steam. Overwatch is dying. Valve does nothing and always wins.About the Game-Team Fortress 2 was released in 2007. At the time of my review, the game is 17 years old. Its a class-based team shooter featuring different game modes payload, capture the flag, king of the hill, point capture, competitive mode, and notably MANN vs. MACHINE.Whats amazing is that, even today, I still want to play this game despite it being 17 years old. For some reason, it creates a friendly atmosphere, even though its gameplay demands practice and skill. Surprisingly, as a gamer seeking relaxation, I wasnt discouraged by the skill requirements.I first discovered this game in my childhood through YouTube videos like Meet the Team. The animated shorts for this game were and remain the best.I also want to mention that the game is still alive thanks to the community. I think everyone has seen memes featuring characters or music from Team Fortress 2.Popular meme with characters from Team Fortresshttpsyoutu.beOXzMdhtzhbc?siEddMizr7-v3mAuPTo this day, a large number of fan-made videos featuring the games characters are being created and will continue to be.Team Fortress, specifically Team Fortress Classic, was one of the first class-based shooters to introduce the concept of character classes and unique abilities. Of course, Team Fortress Classic was a mod for Quake. While it had classes, their gameplay was quite similar, and everyone carried the same weapon set. It was in Team Fortress 2 that this genre fully developed. Without it, many modern games wouldnt exist.Since I mentioned that its a class-based shooter requiring skill, let me explain the classes you can choose from.Meet the TeamScoutUm... I dont even know where to start with you. I mean, do you even know who youre talkin to? D-Do you have any idea, any idea who I am? Oh man, thats beautiful. Heh. Ya listenin? OK. Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and brotha I hurt people. BOINK! Im a Force-A-Nature! If you were from where I was from, youd be  dead!httpsyoutu.begeNMz0J9TEQ?siPH3Ki-55mob0kj2OThe Scout excels at completing objectives quickly. He can capture control points and push carts at twice the rate of other classes. Only the Scout has this ability naturally the Demoman and Soldier share it only with the Pain Train equipped. His speed also makes him ideal for grabbing intelligence briefcases.SoldierIf fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight! Sun Tzu said that, and Id say he knows a little more about fighting than you do, pal, because he invented it, and then he perfected it so that no living man could best him in the ring of honor.httpsyoutu.beh42d0WHRSck?sihVYwPjsBcpmNsO2The Soldier is a crazed, patriotic warrior from the American Midwest. Tough and well-armed, hes versatile and a great class for beginners.PyroIn the video, it shows that Pyro is insanely insane. While burning a town, they imagine blowing rainbows and growing flowers burning buildings, blowing bubbles shooting a flare at a Scout, giving out giant lollipops swinging an axe, and wrapping presents trapping a Medic in a barn and setting it ablaze. Pyroland is their delusional utopia.The Pyro is a mysterious pyromaniac who views their fiery destruction through a whimsical lens, as shown in Meet the Pyro.DemomanPrancin aboot with your heads full of eyeballs!

And if you forgot, consider this a reminder of how cool these characters are. We welcome you back to the game.There was a time when cheaters were rampant, but now their numbers have dropped significantly. Just in the first match, I witnessed 15 players receive VAC bans. Despite the lack of recent updates, making it seem like the game is dead, the community has kept it alive. Its only thanks to you that the game still exists and thrives. Team Fortress 2 is a timeless multiplayer game that has managed to stay relevant for years despite being released in 2007. Its unique blend of humor, class-based gameplay, and strategic depth has created a dedicated community that still enjoys the game today. The colorful, cartoony art style and witty writing make it stand out in a sea of more serious first-person shooters. Every character feels distinct, with each class bringing something different to the table. Whether you prefer the heavy firepower of the Heavy, the tactical precision of the Engineer, or the speed and agility of the Scout, theres a playstyle for everyone.What sets Team Fortress 2 apart from other shooters is the teamwork aspect. Each class is designed to complement the others, meaning successful teams need coordination and communication. Its not just about getting the most kills its about supporting your teammates, setting up defenses, or pushing forward as a group. The game rewards team-based strategies and encourages players to think about the bigger picture, rather than going solo.The games balance between casual fun and competitive depth is another key element. While its easy to jump into a match and enjoy yourself, theres also room for serious players to refine their skills and master each class. The constantly evolving updates, new weapons, and maps help keep the experience fresh, with each update adding new content or gameplay adjustments to keep things interesting.One of the most enjoyable aspects of Team Fortress 2 is its community. The game has a rich history of fan-created content, from custom maps to user-made skins and mods. The games accessibility and open nature have allowed it to grow into something much bigger than just a simple shooter. Despite its age, Team Fortress 2 continues to be an enjoyable and engaging game, filled with quirky moments and memorable experiences that keep players coming back time and time again. Rating 910  Team Fortress 2  is an absolute classic that continues to deliver a unique and endlessly entertaining multiplayer experience. Even after all these years, it remains a standout in the genre, thanks to its distinct style, balanced gameplay, and vibrant community.The first thing that strikes you about  TF2  is its iconic art style. The cartoonish, exaggerated characters and environments give the game a timeless quality that sets it apart from other shooters. Each of the nine classes is meticulously designed with its own strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles, allowing for a level of strategic depth and team synergy that few games can match.Gameplay is fast-paced, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. Whether youre pushing the payload as a Heavy, setting up sentries as an Engineer, or sneaking behind enemy lines as a Spy, every match feels fresh and dynamic. The game modes are varied and cater to different playstyles, ensuring that theres always something new to try.One of  TF2s  greatest strengths is its community. The game has fostered a passionate player base that keeps the experience alive with custom maps, community-designed items, and seasonal in-game events. The humor and personality infused into every aspect of the game make it a joy to play, even when youre on the losing side.While  TF2  has seen its share of ups and downs over the years, its still a must-play for anyone who enjoys team-based shooters. The occasional matchmaking hiccups and older mechanics are small drawbacks compared to the overall experience.In short,  Team Fortress 2  is a gem that has aged like fine wine. Its a game that rewards both skill and teamwork, offering hours upon hours of enjoyment. If you havent given it a try yet, now is the perfect time to jump in and see why its still one of the best multiplayer games out there. This game is a test of time, patience, and evolution. Yes there are memes, hackers, people who dont do shit. Its what gives this game character. The fact that it has stood 11 years of this shit means that it most likely wont go away for a long time unless Valve gives up on it. Its like 4chan, its good and bad, and never goes away. That  one  game where skill doesnt matter, but what does is how fancy your characters look with extremely expensive cosmetics and reskinned weapons..",
        "summary": "This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs arent defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. Once you start, there is no coming back. The memes, lingo, hats, characters, cinematics, voice-lines, guns, cosmetics, maps, updates, art-style and the music, every single thing TF2 has produced is known by all"

        "text": "Bad game with a bad playerbase. TF2 is one of the best games ever made, but thanks to Valves abhorrent neglect, I can no longer recommend this game to anyone. TF2 has remained in a borderline unplayable state for over 5 years. Valves official game servers are flooded with cheaters and cheating bots, rendering the game unplayable for most hours of the day. Players are now completely reliant on operating their own servers in order to enjoy the game. Valve has completely ignored TF2s problems, while simultaneously profiting millions off of in-game microtransactions year after year.This neglectful treatment has clearly become a company-wide problem. Counter-Strike 2 is experiencing a cheater infestation. Left for Dead servers experience waves of DDOS attacks. And rather than maintain their currently offered and HEAVILY monetized titles, Valve has the audacity to be working on yet another game, guaranteed to be filled to the brim with monetization features, while leaving their other games to rot. Its nothing but pure greed from a multi-billion dollar corporation.Rather than addressing the cheating bots, Valve has only opted to apply band-aid fixes in the form of removing in-game communication features for free to play accounts. Bot hosters frequently use in-game text and voice chat to spam nonsense, or even doxx other players. Given that these stopgaps are avoided by simply spending a few dollars on the in-game store, or by using stolen accounts, this has done nothing to mitigate the bot problem, and has only served to further punish players. This is all the effort Valve was willing to muster a few years ago, which only amplified the already horrific experiences for anyone new to the game.Its laughable that Valve, with their vast resources, has allowed for these problems to persist as long as they have while doing absolutely nothing. Shameful. Pathetic. Asinine. No combination of words is enough to fully convey the weight of their willful neglect.So long as TF2 is offered as playable with incentivized microtransactions, and Valve profits from it, it should at the very least be playable. Until it is, I cant recommend this game to anyone. This isnt a joke review, I know I have close to 4k hours in this game and thats not including all the different modsconsole versions Ive played as I really, really, really love this game. Its been a staple of my teenageyoung adult life, and there truly has never been nor will there ever be a game to replace it. Im not recommending it because this game just isnt like it used to be due to neglect from its developers and the experience for a newer player is most likely to be abysmal. The game is infested with bots and cheaters as Valve, the multibillion dollar corporation with all the resources in the world, chooses to do nothing about it. Their way of combating this was butchering the experience for a free to play user by heavily restricting communication, instead of, you know, developing an anti-cheat thats actually worth a damn. But even then, I wouldnt mind cheaters that much if it werent for the god-awful matchmaking system thats been stinking up this game since 2016 like a half-opened jar of rancid horse radish you forgot in the back of your cupboard since Bill Clintons daughter got her dads dick wet. Seriously, after all these years, I still cannot fathom a single positive thing it added to the game and were reaping the consequences of its addition as the botcheater problem wouldnt be anywhere near as bad as it is now if it werent for its inclusion. Even if you do get in a game thats absent of cheaters, theres still a good 80 chance that the game you join will be a complete steam roll either with or against your favor. Playing with friends and trying to introduce them to this game always goes south as it consists of wait 10 minutes to be put in a match, wait another minute for everyone to join, have both rounds end in less than 5 minutes due to the teams being utterly stacked, wait 5 minutes for a map vote, then leave the game and re-queue for an additional 10 minutes anyways because half the server rage-quitted after last match. Oh, and pray to god one of your friends doesnt get autobalanced halfway through, as theres basically no way you can change teams unlike years before.Because how you played the game before, you looked in the server browser, found a server that was running a mapgamemode you liked, joined with your friends, and if the game was unbalanced you could either manually join the losing team to help them, or have autoscramble kick in which worked at least half of the time. It wasnt perfect, but I 1000 prefer it over the utter nightmare that is modern matchmaking. Its not nostalgia either, a community made mod called Team Fortress 2 Classic has that old system I just mentioned and I can play that game for literal hours in a single day, something I havent done with normal TF2 in the longest time due to how frustrating it is to simply get put in a match. I cant even really put my finger on it but this matchmaking system has been the WORST thing I have ever seen added to a video game and I think its going to pre-maturely kill this game.I have a bit of a lovehate relationship with this games community, but at the end of the day Ive realized if you play this in 2023 youre just going to encounter every flavor of manchild there is. Hope you enjoy playing with obnoxious furries, weaboos, racists, and pride flag waving weirdos you probably shouldnt have around your children. I guess theres nothing inherently wrong with having these people present in your playerbase, but if these groups consist of the majority, then that really says a lot about the absolute state of your game. We get updates every summerHalloweenChristmas that consist of community made content with absolutely ZERO 0 quality control. I know the art style has been dead since the inclusion of paints in like 2010, but oh my god the new stuff thats being added to the game is almost inexcusable and quite embarrassing. Im talking about cosmetics that have no regard for the intended art-style and throw teamclass recognition out the window, maps that not only play like shit but look like babys first project with the hammer editor being OFFICIALLY ADDED TO THE GAME. Valve literally cannot be damned to get at least 1 single person to check the quality of the content thats being included to one of their most popular IPs that rakes in tons of cash. So yeah, if youre a new player or somebody thinking about getting back into TF2, I wouldnt bother. I want this game to be remembered for its stunning legacy throughout the early 10s, offering the most fun experience you could have online, and not the pathetic zombie that it is now. Theres nothing like it, but theres a lot of video games out there you can waste your time with. Dont waste your time with this one. Save it for something more enjoyable and do not enable Valves neglect by blowing your wallet on stupid cosmetic items. i am thinking life is not real nothing is there and my brain make everything up EVERYTHING it make up jesus mohammed usa china somali universe trump putin tf2 n video friends EVERYTHING and i think my brain make up everything in different time place universe and can amke up everything again and again and it all game of making up everything including plants animals grapics blu team red team and EVERYTHING. me when i look at that screen is almost actualy my thoughts when i think like the medic and engineer. when person think that way everything look funny but nobody can say it is not true because when person say it is not true is because i make it so that they say it is not true and i want to prove it is true and they say it is not true but i know it is true. so when i frag, that is the way i make it to be. TF2s community is one of the greatest gaming communities of all time. The energy and passion of the community is simply unrivaled, I simply cannot do it justice by trying to list all the things they have done out of love for this game, and at one point, was the most amazing place to meet genuine and passionate people who just wanted to have a good time and were welcoming to new players. But sadly, they are being neglected. Malicious users have created automated accounts called bots that join games and use cheats to disrupt the game and make it unplayable. This has left TF2 and its community in a bad place for a long time No new players stay because of the issue, veteran players migrate to privately hosted servers just so they can play normally, and discontent with Valve and the games state is at an all time high. Something has to change. To put this into perspective Valve has made it clear they are aware of this issue for a long time, they know the game is unplayable, and they are okay with that to save money. How are the fans rewarded for their hard work? Their dedication? Their loyalty? Even the money they put into the game? Absolutely nothing. The community must band together and tell Valve that it is time to fix Team Fortress 2. Ive played this game for thousands of hours. It used to be my favorite.Valve has pretty clearly given up on TF2. Item servers are constantly down, bots run rampant, and cheats are the status quo.What used to be the best shooter ever made is now a sad, desiccated corpse being given the Weekend at Bernies treatment to milk more money out of a nostalgic crowd. Game is currently unplayable due to cheaters and bots with no end in sight.In addition to the cheating problem, lets not forget that Valve was the first western company to introduce loot creates into video games.Valve did that.  Not EA, not Activision, not Blizzard.... TF2 was the first.So now its free-to-play despite that I paid for it, and also unplayable because it costs nothing for cheaters to create an account... Let me just say i love TF2 and the community. I bought the game back in 2007 and have been playing consistently for almost 17 years. It is so disappointing to see valve not care about fixing the bot crisis in the game  they rubbed salt in the wounds 2 years ago during the previous save TF2 movement by saying they recognise the issue and are working on it  then crickets. Nothing, nada  a big donkey punch to the back of the head  they will happily take our money and rely almost exclusively on the community for new maps and cosmetics yet treat the player base with contemptIt is such a shame what the game has become and causal mode is often unplayable. More recently I became aware of the mammoth idle bot numbers that over-inflate the player base and market which drive up the prices on keys. I mean how on earth can someone create a personal vac server that is not accessible on the community server list, fill it with idle bots they own to earn loot drops which they then package up and sell on market places.I watched Uncle Danes latest video which mad me mad at valve httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v82B38TaawfE Then this TF2 video on idle bot crisis made me more mad and sad httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vnnuxHZm73PUI really hope Ill be able to play this game with my son, but maybe thats just a pipe dream. Please sell the game Gabe to a developer company that will actually do something about the problem if you dont have the spine to do anythingFIXTF2  httpssave.tf Heres a list to do for the janitor thats still working on this gameA working anti cheat to solve the hacking issue with bots in servers.Some kind of preventive method to disallow the use of text only clients to prevent afk bots farming items and inflating the real player numbers.Fix your game valve, your recent performance with cs2 with all its bugs and bots has been disappointing, make it up for the communities.Fixtf2 my son bought me this game for fathers day, played it for 12 minutes got bored and uninstalled. 410.oh wait that doesnt say 12 minutes that says 12 thousand hours... shit how long have i been here i told my family i was out buying milk and cigarettes This game has been overrun by bots and has become borderline unplayable. I used to play this game every time came home, now I dont even touch it because of how bad the bots have become. Valve, please fix. Trying to add a matchmakingquickplay system has only harmed this game then it has ever helped it, even before casual, back to the time when quickplay was added, there were reports of community servers struggling to properly fill up there player slots, alongside complaints of being shoved into servers filled with valve bots, or servers with virus ridden MOTDs, quickplay had many many flaws, but community servers still had thrived. But by the time casual was added? So many community servers now were not only struggling, but had straight up died to the point where only a few had remained and were constantly full cause no one had anywhere else to go. The bot crises Id argue is, in fact, a direct result of the casual matchmaking system allowing bot hosters to fill party queues with them, it only takes 4 full parties to fill a valve server btw. This, in addition to disallowing ad-hoc and votekicking on valve official servers, has created an incredibly exploitative and abusable system that makes trying to play on official servers feel like pulling teeth, this isnt sustainable, and since valve servers lack proper moderation or community created anti-cheats, there is no longer a possible way of managing this.Where does that leave us? While I cant say in good faith that valve should just remove casual outright even though thats what id think is best, I do think its become clear that the way it is designed has always been extremely flawed, and that community servers, due to the fundamental way theyre managed by real people, do not suffer these horrendous list of issues. I think valve, rather then trying to fix the casual system and all the complication that entails, should instead look to the community and support the servers within the server browser that are still keeping the game truly alive. I think a good start to this would be updating the UI of the server browser which hasnt changed since 2007. In the browsers current state, it is extremely archaic and unintuitive for newer players whod sooner use the casual search tool due to its simpler nature. We think both giving it a fresh, more accessible look and encouraging its use over casual is a good first step in the right direction. After bolstering the server browser, valve could potentially work closer with the community and what the larger tf2 community to take notes to improve both their own servers along with ours. In summary, I think community servers have been the lifeblood of this game ever since release, and I think valve could help this game a lot more by contributing to and bolstering those communities rather then fixing a flawed server system that people have been complaining about ever since meet your match happened, Whether valve fixes their servers or not, the future of this game has and always will be the communities that people create within it. I absolutely love this game and have loved it since I was a child. I have been playing for about 12 years, sank 2450 hours, and 600 into it. I absolutely love the hats, love the gameplay, and love the community. There is no game I know of that combines customization, creativity, dynamic gameplay, teamwork, and gambling so seamlessly into one. I am writing this review to express my dissatisfaction not with how the game plays or operates, but how it has been abandoned by its parent company, Valve. Bots have overrun servers for about 7 years, gameplay updates are a thing of the past, new weapons have not been added in years, and anti-cheat is never enforced. All of this would point to TF2 being a dead and retired game, which is sad, but all good things come to an end. Valve does not see it this way. They still produce regular updates in the gambling and cosmetic department, resulting in more and more money being poured in for less and less quality. Eventually, one day, the players will have enough of being overrun by bots and players will leave. When the players leave, the market collapses, and when that happens, no more money for Valve or fun for the players of this historic game. For the players, fix the bots. For the community, communicate with players. For the money, if that is all you care about, Valve, fix your game before it is too late. Valve has always done this thing where they dont say a word about anything because its easier than communicating with your playerbase and then having that playerbase hold you to your word or expect you to do something. Combine that with their casual approach of only having people work on something if they want to, and you get the current state of TF2.Technically they COULD be doing something, there could be a whole team working on it and trying to figure out how to fix the game, but in reality thats nothing more than wishful thinking. We only know that theres like 1 guy doing barebones maintenance on this game, and bless that person honestly.However, it just doesnt make any sense. You can ignore any sort of emotional appeal to TF2s legacy, community, importance for the industry or Valve, anything subjective and sentimental? You can wipe that out and it still wouldnt make sense because even if you ignore that, its still a massive game that makes Valve a truckload of money. Youd think it would be in their interest to ensure that the game is in a healthy and appealing state. Not just to avoid bleeding players or attracting new ones which obviously feeds into trading and their income, but for their own image. You think people would be paying clown prices for a garrish hat with even more hideous special effects if TF2 had 1k players? Obviously not. The same way, investing into a game that might just get abandoned and overrun by cheaters doesnt seem too appealing.I despise the skin market that Valve created, so its annoying to make arguments based on it, but it certainly seems like Valve would care more about money than anything else. It seems clear that theres no artistic drive to support something youve created, and theres clearly no sense of responsibility to at least maintain it in a proper state for the sake of hundreds of thousands of people who love TF2. Got 4.5k hours here,5.5k on another account. Been playing for about 12 years, Ive seen most of the bugs, happenings and problems of this game, but now, its another case. Last update was SEVEN YEARS AGO. 7. Bots have overrun the whole game. Cheats are so rampant that youll get cheaters fighting for who has the best client hack. Scammers, phishers and shakers are just hoarding everything for insane prices.Trades in game have been broken for a year now.We still miss the promised heavy update. Its a game that needs so little to be fixed, but Valve prefers to suck it dry while it could reach top popularity with no problem. 10 developers for just a million a year wont make a dent in your profits, while you get that much in a month despite the unplayable state of the game. FK you valve, on the same level of EA, Nintendo and Ubisoft. Game is still great, fascinating classes, diverse strategies, casual, laid-back environment to play, which is quite hard to find in modern shooters. One of a kind game, Id say.The only problem is that Valve is in charge of maintaining this game. A tragedy. Nowadays, servers are filled with blatant, automated aimbots. And you know what? That Nowadays is, in fact, last 5 years.I love TF2 itself still, but I despise Valve for not taking responsibility for their game THIS much.Therefore, I dont recommend it. Unless Valve change their mind, this problem wont go away, so.FixTF2. As many hours as I have put into the game, I cannot in good faith recommend the game to anyone. The bot crisis in TF2 has gone on for years, and Valve has essentially abandoned the game, minus making quick bucks from supply crates. I dont see it changing in the near future, so save yourself the grief and not play this game. 2,138-ish hours was my time in Team Fortress 2 in 2019. Since then, it has gone up around 60 hours, and the stunted time is all down to the Bot issues and my repeated attempts to play it. The Bot problems of TF2 are a perfect encapsulation of why VAC doesnt work it relies too little on automation, too much on manual waves, and theres no work being done in the background to satiate any player who just wants to play Casual.But just play community servers. Thats NOT a solution to the problem, that is running away from the issue at hand and circumventing it. Praying to  would be just as effective a solution than just playing on community servers.Here is the bitter Pill people dont want to swallow, the scroll of truth they continually throw away because what the sought after was too real for them Valve likes Illegal Gambling. It likes loot boxes, it likes its storefront filled with shoddy asset-flipped games they cant be bothered to sift through or have any semblance of QA for. That is the reality, and people need to start accepting that.Since 2015, Valve made it big with Lootboxes and weapon skins in CSGO, and since then, has had one thing on their mind, and that has been How can we players part with their money while still looking like the good guys of PC Gaming?. Turns out, when you have rabid fans who will go for bat to defend you whenever you screw up, you can get away with a lot of stuff. Quelle Surprise that breeds complacency among users and a situation where you cant escape Steam.The bots of TF2 are emblematic of Valves Sloth-like tendencies. Unwilling to make any move to solve or fix a problem until they think its perfection incarnate, lest they be seen as the bad guy or the solution is seen as unfit. VAC itself is antiquated, old hat, a leaky steam pipe system with so many cracks and buckets catching water that its impossible to ignore. Theres a reason players call VAC the derogatory nickname Valve Allows Cheaters because...well...they kinda do.TF2 is infested with Bots because Valve doesnt have the cajones to try anything, because stopping the bots, stemming the flow, does not compute with their focus on making money off of skins, cosmetics, cards, taunts, or really anything else sold via TF2 or the marketplace. That is their goal, and they will not stop until weve left or the money runs dry.Stop playing TF2, Stop using Steam or the very least try to limit your Steam usage yes, Im aware of the irony presented here and play something else on some other platform. Hell, some games are DRM-Free and can be played away from Steam if you download them first. If Valve has any sense, theyll listen to the feedback and the reviewbombing and the petition and the calls to action and make TF2 playable again by purging the bots, either with a more effective Anti-Cheat, or with some more technical wizardry. If not, and were still in the same boat one year from now, well, we have our answer for the future.fixTF2 Team Fortress 2 rn is literally unplayable. Its just filled with aimbotting bots in practically every lobby  dont ev en try to play casual in the morning or night . And Im not talking about casual system which is just requeue simulator. Community servers is the only safe place for now. Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game ever, period. I remember loving everything about it, the characters, the style, the satisfying gameplay, but now its all being ruined by bots. Bots and those who host them are destroying the game, and making public lobbies unplayable, which destroys the social aspect of this game. Valve has taken zero actions against the bots who swat, dox, and commit malicious acts against those who stand up to them or speak up.Valve, please fix this game, please pay attention to this game. This game may be old but it has a loyal fanbase and long-time fans who want to keep playing. Team Fortress 2 is one of your most legendary titles and its time to treat it with the respect it deserves.",
        "summary": " TF2 is one of the best games ever made, but thanks to Valves abhorrent neglect, I can no longer recommend this game to anyone. Valve has completely ignored TF2s problems, while simultaneously profiting millions off of in-game microtransactions year after year. Bad game with a bad playerbase."

        "text": "I could endlessly attest to the sheer quality of this game, but instead I will tell you how much the developers care about its quality to prove it.Up until the 2.0 release, the game had a very traditional open world map. You entered the zone from a single point, and could go anywhere on the map to explore and loot.There are some severe flaws with this approach however.Loot is finite, meaning if you explore a location once, and collect all of its loot, there is literally no reason to ever revisit it.In order to reach the norther parts of the map, you had to travel about a day past tons of dangerous shit in order to loot and stuff. In other words, playing the game becomes more of a chore and time investment as you go on just to explore the late game stuff.Given that traveling to the late game areas took about a days travel every time, you either had to fight in darkness or sleep. The problem with sleeping though is that you had a sleeping bag where you could sleep at ANY TIME. Literally. You didnt have to think or strategize, just plot it down and boom, its daytime. Even worse, it could heal you as well.After you get about halfway up the map, the enemy variety just stagnates horribly. You almost fight exclusively like 2 enemies ever, which is a shame cause theres a whole lot of them to use and fighting against some of them just becomes a hassle in environments that make fighting either way too close or way too far staying vague so I dont spoil enemy discovery cause thats a lot of the fun.And so what did the devs do in response to these significant, fundamental design problems.They scrapped it.The WHOLE... FUCKING,.. MAP.As a student in game design myself, I can attest that is NO small task to do, throwing out months of work building, testing, and refining an ENTIRE WORLD MAP simply to make it better.And with this marked 2.0. Now the world map is split into sections, all of which have multiple entry points already an improvement, interconnect to each other, and some of which connect directly to your base. And more than that you can only go back to base through those points, whereas previously you could walk anywhere off the map and be teleported home.Additionally, enemy variety is not only increased with enemies that already exist, but many new enemies have been made as well, with different zones having different assortments. And even more than that, maps can change according to you mission to add even more, different varieties to you travels.Loot is now respawnable, giving you both reason to explore places over again, and also pressure to plan out your trips so you dont get stranded in the zone when the respawn wave hits, which puts you in danger.Traveling to high level areas is not always a long travel, if you unlock the base fast travel points, but it also gives you another goal to unlock those fast travel points, encouraging exploration. Oh, and the sleeping bag is gone, demanding you explore to find those sleeping spots as well.The developers completely tore down and mostly deleted all of their work on the map, and made tons more enemies and fixed so much balance to make the game the best it could possibly be, and it worked. Having played both versions, I highly admire the dedication and grit it takes to make such a dangerous, expensive, and time consuming descision, all to make the game even better.Needless to say, I can highly recommend the game in its current form, hell I could have given it a moderately strong recommendation in the 1.0, but now I can even promise, it will get even better than it is now, and I already love it. I feel like personal experiences are some of the best ways to explain the appeal of a game to someone.After fifteen minutes of silently picking through the remains of an empty construction site, I began climbing a crane.I got a pretty good ways up the crane, and could see the yellowed plastic of a container that might hold a gun or ammo.I was running quite low on ammo, and I had neglected to clean what few weapons I did have before entering The Radius.I excitedly hurried up the creaking, rusty body of the crane.I heard the crack of a fired round in the distance, then the bullet zipping by my head.It scared the absolute shit out of me.Lost my grip and fell a hundred feet, died on impact.And yes, yes I did scream on the whole way down.Highly recommend.Edit after doubling my playtime up to 57 hours This game has stolen many hours of would-be sleep from me. I am having a great time. Great game, time spent so far  20 - Looting10 - Shooting5 - Screaming65 - Organising all my gear into neat little piles on the shelving unit.1010 Would Buy Againe Easily the best vr game on the marketeverything is so atmospherici know its not trying to be stalker vr but i feel it should lean more into its roadside picnic sideAll this game needs now is better mod support model swaps are cool but i need more this game is THE BEST immersive survival game i have ever played, not just for VR, but as a WHOLE.some i like to call Brain Dead, say its just a STALKER clone and they might be right in a sense, but ever since the new 2.0 update the game is now its own whole structured vr game. everything in this game is unique, from the map locations to the home base, to the enemies, to the collectibles, TO THE GAME MECHANICS, OH YES PLEASE LET ME TALK ABOUT THE GAME MECHANICS! this game is no boneworksyet but your hands dont just go through walls, you have to actually open cupboards, creates, doors, and CLIMB to access certainmost items.the maps are no procedural but the loot that spawns doesnt come back until something called The Tide happens, The Tide is an event inwhich happens every 5 in-game days and YOU CANNOT CONTROL IT!you can however sleep through it it completely wipes the mapall maps of their current loot and completely respawns everything, this includes but is not limited to things like Quest Items, regular Loot like Food and Guns and Ammo, and also Artifacts. The Tide also fiddles with The Playersyou current location, so if you wait for the tide in a map, dont worry, you wont die, it wont even take anything from your inventory, it just ends any Quests you were working on and places you on a completely Random spot on the map, such as inbetween 56 and a half entities who would love nothing more then to rip the skin from your bones and devour your spinal cord.so just try to get home in time, also getting back home is absolutely painfully immersive, you always enter The Map through a Guide Line which you must fallow back home, so the way you went into The Map, is the same way you will be leaving. this means if you walk all the way to the other side of the map you will either have to Keep On Truckin through the next map or you gotta walk ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL THE WAY BACK to The Guide Line, however their is a total of 3 different Guide Lines which lead back home so its not As Painful as it could be.The Player Home is fucking LIT!you can actually realistically store your items like guns and ammo and Devious Stones on the shelves and THEY WONT FINIC THE FUCK OUT OF THEIR SPOT WHEN YOU LEAVE, THATS RIGHT! YOU CAN TRUST THIS GAME TO NOT HAVE YO SHIT FREAKING DISAPPEAR WHEN YOU LOAD BACK INWHY AAA GAME DEVELOPERSWHY HOW IN THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR HELL CAN A SMALL INDIE STUDIO WITH A THOUSAND TIMES LESS FUNDING AND BACKING ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING YO STANKY ASS BITCHES HAVE YET TO EVER DO????rant over.The Gunsfirst off i should mention that the way your character and his clumsy hands hold your weapon is rotated incorrectly across different headsets, if your on valve index or The Vive, or oculus or whatever the gun WILL NOT ALIGN with your controllers correctly. BUT THE BEST PART is that you can CHANGE IT and FIX IT!WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SUCH A FUCKING SIMPLE SETTING WOULD-oh wait i already did my rant...anyway. Guns, there are a lot of em, from pistols to shotguns to snipers to rifles, all with their own ammo typeaccurately named mind you, so if yall Gun Nuts remember what caliber a M16A1 fires, good for you and even more different TYPES of ammo, not only do we got Regular shit like FMJbut also AP, and Surplus, FMJ is fine, AP removes entities like Mr. Clean on Speed whilst cleaning your kitchen, but its about the same price as Speed which can make a dent in your budget, Surplus is Dollar Store Ammo, literally, its incredibly cheap, Costco Deluxe over here, 100 for 1 special. it will take you more then a full magazine to kill anything, but the the money you save by strictly buying surplus will be worth it, someday, you too, might be able to afford that Security Level 6 Mosin-Negant Scope Attachment so you can hit entities from far away with your Sec Lvl 0 9mm PPK Markarov.the guns also GET DIRTY when you fire them, and over time, they will noticeably begin to look like its been placed inside someones rectum. requiring you to clean it by spraying it with offbrand WD-40 and using your only toothbrush to clean off the poopy, you can even clean the barrel to further reduce the chanced of jammingoh yeah, guns also jam when they aint clean, so do thatCurrently the game gets regular monthly updates, fallowed by around 3-6 small updates of small patches and very smallbut still useful QoL additions. the game also has a dedicated official discord server where you can premote your contentwhich the game is in dire need of btw, and even report bugs which, in my case, will usually get patched the next fucking daythey are that On Pointits very fun and i highly recommend Into the Radius as its one of the best VR games ive ever played, at this point nothing is going to stop me from strapping my headset to my skull and relying on Drone Delivered Chinese Food after i welded my door shut.Late March 2022 Edit it has been awhile since ive played this game however dispite the rapid and amazing changes the team has brought to this game my wack ass thesis long review still stands. i just want to take a few sentances to thank you all for granting me one of the top reviews for this game but also the devs for allowing me to review it. never before has a game been done so well, crafted so meticulously, all with the thoughts of the player in mind.thank you, -Thaddeus Yeet Meistermid april 2023 editthis game is actually better then sex. This is going to sound lame but this game has the best VR inventory system ever made This is easily one of the best VR games out there. As of writing this review, I have 4 hours in. I bought this game last night. Let me go into detail on one of my experiencesI had just bought the OTS A 9x18mm pistol, same round as the starter Makarov, but with a much larger magazine capacity. I decided a quick mission to the anomaly field near the dorms would be a good test drive. The first part of my mission goes off without a hitch. I go in, weave my way through the anomalies and petrified trees, and collect the Steps artifact. I can see the dorms on a hill nearby, and coming down towards me is a fragment. Normally, fragments are transparent, barely visible until you hear them scream at you and catch a glimpse of them shambling up to you. One or two shots to center mass will put it down.This fragment was different. It was solid black, clearly visible against the grayish brown ground. I put my probes back on my wrist, pulled out my gun, waited for it to get close, and shot it twice in the chest. That was when I learned you should never get cocky in this game. The frag didnt die. I slammed my finger onto the thumbstick to dash backwards and nearly stumbled into one of the anomalies. I proceeded to waste half of the precious ammo in my magazine on the foul creature before it warped into a black web with an orb resembling the radius itself in the center. Having no other ideas, I gave it a poke with my knife. Only then did it finally die.I decided, in my infinite wisdom, to search the dorms for more loot. I slowly pushed my way into the buildings foyer. I could hear the footsteps of another frag in the hallway above me. I found nothing of interest in the rooms on the first floor, so I proceeded to the second floor, navigating my way around the glowing green slime hanging from the ceiling at eye level with my gun trained on the corner opposite me. The rest of the hall was blocked off, but I could see the frag I heard walking around behind the barricade. It was another black one. I pulled my gun again and reached around the barricade to shoot it, managing to settle my nerves enough to get six rounds on target and put one final round through the black orb, killing it.After not finding anything, and being unable to pass the barricade, I decided it was a good idea to look outside for a way into the barricaded part of the dorms. As I left the building and turned the corner, I heard the scream of another fragment through the bushes in front of me.And then another.Before long, there were several fragments surrounding me. I was out of ammo. I desperately tried to knock myself out of my freeze response and . Despite being so close to the edge of the radius, it looked so far. The more I looked, the more fragments I saw, all of them jet black. It sounded as if they were right behind me. Half way there, I stopped for breath, looked back, and saw nothing. I didnt know if they were following me, but I wasnt sticking around to find out. I breathed a sigh of relief as I slipped back through the fog to safety.When I got back to base, I instinctively opened my bag and lit a cigarette. I dont even smoke. Something about lighting up a virtual cigarette is comforting and I dont know how to explain it. By the time it had burned down, I had collected the reward for the artifact and bought four boxes of 9x18mm and two spare magazines. Im carrying more ammo from now on. That is, if I can manage to drag myself out of the safety of the base.Until that point, I had never felt genuine panic from a video game. step 1 purchase gamestep 2 finish tutorialstep 3 walk into first mission bunkerstep 4 Foot steps outsidestep 5 gun jam no ammostep 6 drop gunstep 7 pull out knifestep 8 drop knifestep 9 diestep 10 horrific PTSD step 11 never sleep again The first ever video game that I refunded because it was too scary. Its so very good, but Im so very weak with horror games. 1010 would cry again. One of the few VR games that I can say for sure IS A GAME, and not some tech demo alpha with 30 minutes of fun. Game needs MP, playing together with friends and getting paranoid together is more fun then getting paranoid alone. Why dont you get Into the Radius of some Bes?The game is good, maybe even great- especially for an indie VR game. I would personally say that this is one of the best VR games I have played.With the 2.0 update that released in late 2021 the game was almost born anew with how much was changed. At this time the game is still being updated and improved upon, and I hope CM Games keeps improving this existential dread simulator as time goes on.If you like guns, shooting things with guns, maintaining said guns after shooting things, and waking up in your shipping-container home to another day in hell, then youll surely enjoy this game! This game is absolutely stellar and its almost criminal the devs are offering this on the cheap. If you are a fan of the STALKER series, the games, the book it was based off Roadside Picnic youre going to feel right at home, anomalies, monsters and goods to loot and salvage from the Zone In this its called the Radius. The game-play is amazing I have to manually reload my magazines, plot my routes and take my time pushing through areas, carefully. This isnt a Call of Duty style experience this game pays dividends when you take your time, asses and take a tactical approach.ProsThe world is plenty large enough to explore with areas quite detailed.Plenty of mini easter eggs and stuff to find all over.Weapon selection is pretty on point, this isnt say, the Arsenal mod from STALKER but there are plenty of guns to play around with, clean and feed ammo through including my ALL TIME FAVORITE WEAPON the AS Val.Goodies and secrets are hidden EVERYWHERE I found a gun No spoilers Hidden in the small crack of a couch, stuffed underneath it for safe keeping, many of these weapons can be found out with notes left throughout the world but the game pays hard for exploring and looking around, searching, climbing and otherwise thinking past the flat horizontal plane youre used to in most games, looking up at a roof and you see a small area you can climb up? Guess what, theres probably a goodie up there, a weapon, a stash.Anomalies feel scary and unique, once you start to recognize them and navigate them properly you really start to feel like a veteran of the radius. Then, next thing you know you encounter something brand new and have to take a moment to work out how it works.Gunplay and equipment feel super good, dropping mags in a combat situation for a faster reload instead of stowing them feels so damned sexy, loading rounds into mags and fitting them in the tac vest feels so good and there is legit strat to managing your side pouch and vest. Heres a tip STALKERS always keep an open slot on your tac vest for quick mag storage when you run dry.ConsLack of enemies, its a small dev team so I understand, but I would relish seeing the enemies expanded, once you get a feel for the few monsters there are you kinda see them everywhere. On the plus side most arnt insta-gibs and can be dealt with with proper planning.Punishing as hell. I found myself saving a lot because sometimes the game world was really weird, like mimics firing on me from nearly outside render range even when I was stalking and moving through cover SAVE A LOT because this game will brutalize you sometimes at random intervals.Anomalies Some of them are a bit, buggy it goes up above with saving a lot, like running through a strand anomaly that was glitching through the floor and barely sticking out of the ground,s tepped on it, took damage that could have been avoided. Same with the angry grass, had it sticking out of a wall at a weird angle once and even when flashlighting it to make it retreat, because it was angled, walking by still pegged me with damage.Keep in mind for my cons its all stuff thats easily fixed so dont you dare let that deter you. In closing if the devs are looking a few things Id relish seeing added.Mimics should drop their guns, even if theyre in bad condition, the feel of looting firearms in games like stalker is SOOOO good. Ive always played the salavage and supply sort using a shop as an absolute last resort.Id like to see supply boxes respawn after some time, make it a long while, but going back to loot spots and flipping open a box just to see what pops out is a beautiful feeling. So make those boxes respawn after some time, hell, make us pay a fee to have the group were working for air-drop more in, that way it can be mingled with gameplay.Id love to see some human enemies, bandits and other survivors, make them few and far between and I know Mimics mostly fill this role, but I think adding a variance between humans and mimics would be splendid.All in all, to anyone reading this, this is worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY I spent on it, its not the most beautiful game out there, its not some perfectly polished gem, but this, this is a diamond of a game. I barely write reviews, but Into the Radius deserves this praise. When you sit there and look at your VR setup and wonder what 2-3 playable games having substance may be worth the hassle of working with VR, its a wonder why VR was even released. The shovelware is like a Nintendo marketplace. The glaring ideas VR can accommodate are there for devs but not a lot have gotten it yet.    I am a massive fan of the STALKER franchise and everything associated with related tropes. Into the Radius isnt a 1 to 1 clone, having some different flavor put into the STALKER formulas broth. Im not going to sit here and ramble on about one game being like another and share similarities, the point is if youre a fan this is the best so far for a VR experience. This game is jank, has questionable choices, and could spend more time further developing some realism. The story is told to you under the guise of a disembodied voice, and I dont care much for it. Its sappy and has an undercooked feeling, but at least may or may not have influences from a big dumb wish granting radioactive rock. You get more feeling out of the environmental storytelling than the written narrative. The warped landscaped or abandoned areas are interesting being aided so much from a VR perspective, keeping the player invested in the area around them and then the gameplay follows suit. That being said the graphical limitations from the hardware make some areas look like utter shit but its presented in such a way that you dont worry about it, because youre on your last magazine trying to return to base under the cover of darkness then a boogeyman is trying to finger the last bit of food out of your can. That delapotated rubble turns from a smash of polygons to a safe haven as you fire your anti-rape flare and accertain how many goober grabbers are after your canned goods. Unfortunately, the controls sometimes feel like it bolsters being a victim of sexual assault, as your body doesnt really work the way you want it to when you need it most. The backpack and gun handling are OK, this needs some work. Storage is done with use of a backpack that can be freely grabbed at any time from your back. Items are stored in floating space and up to your organization skills, but as it gets filled up trying to grab something specific can turn into frustration. Theres a weapon slot on your back as well, and interactions between the two can lead to grabbing the wrong thing especially when one hand is doing something else. What you want to do and what happens sometimes doesnt translate, and is most obvious with climbing. Climbing is alright, but requires janking yourself at times to elevate the character model and doesnt flow. Going down is a nightmare, the pistol holster on your leg wants more love than the rusty ladder rung you want to spend time with, next thing you know you and your little shooter are on a date to the bottom of a dark, dank shaft. Dont use the command crouch, actually crouch. It messes up the camera and limits player movement, I stand when I play and do the motions myself but this could be an issue for chair sitters.      Soundscape is good, firing sounds like youre shooting something and not a little firecracker. The Radius is devoid of life, so animal noises are absent but more environmental noises would add a lot. Wind or what have you, buildings moan and phantoms ring, but those can enthusiasts sound a little bit bored and have the air of a low quality spooky monster noise. The atmosphere is there but refinement is needed.   I saved combat as a sort of closer, since I draw the most issues from this. Some of the firearms just wouldnt work the way they are manipulated in game, and being an autist this bugs me so bad. Being in VR its right in your face. AKs charging on safe, inability to ghost load shotguns or see the tubular magazine, the double barrel not locking to fire without the press of a controller button... Take it as you will. The nature of the Goober Grabbers are that of shadow people, bullet impact isnt really felt until hitting something with more substance, leaving minor bullet holes when you really want to see the moonwalkers back explode from a point blank 12 gauge inserting its load directly onto the assailants chest. I have a sinking suspicion the games bullets go off track from the point of aim as an artificial accuracy hinderance, I cant confirm but when you shoot a pistol one handed versus holding it with two it seems off. Anomalies are so-so, leaving me desiring some more depth. The good comes from feeling like youre actually finding a path yourself over anomaly fields youve traversed before, plotting routes based off it and the like. Dont play on the Story difficulty, youll ruin it for yourself. The topography is limited by the map itself but still fun to actually use land navigation with what little you have, a handheld lensatic compass and expanded map would be amazing. Over the course of the game you go from a retard to knowing what youre doing, feeling like becoming a veteran STALKER.   If you read to here, I left things disjointed and ambiguous to try and establish intrigue and highlight some downsides youll face. The developers have a roadmap and have followed suit with it so far, regularly updating with content or fixes that stem away from the usual early access added new hat, fixed localization error over the span of 4 months. DLSS was added recently at the time of writing allowing it to be run on more hardware, so if youre worried about performance they are actively doing things to help. Having higher end hardware myself I havent ran into many issues and DLSS helped even more so. I still have to run an external fan blowing at my computer so my Nvidia doesnt turn into a thermonuclear device, but thats just VR in general. Im cynical when it comes to video games, even more so to the early release scam that for some reason people eat up, but Into The Radius deserves your attention with the game presented being a fleshed out experience not seen in VR. I leave the little shred of hope I have left in video game development with these devs, theyve earned it. The best VR game in my opinion. It may not have the polish or details that Alyx has but Alyx is a linear experience. For gamers like myself that prefer to roam around and do your own thing, this is in many ways a more funimmersive game. As you probably already know, its STALKER but in VR. If you havent played STALKER or Metro, its a bit like if Fallout was more serious.This game is the ultimate inventoryloot game. You manage ever bullet. Every clipmag. Every gun. Your food. Everything. You accept missions, stock up, go out and complete them, and return to your base. Its an addicting gameplay loop.Also, the devs are still updating the game and supporting it! Great devs that care about the community.Personally, if these devs took the gameplay of this and inserted it into an open-world zombie survivalloot game, itd be the greatest gaming experience I can imagine.

Great fun so far, not very challenging though. Maybe you dont understand the appeal? Maybe this is just some bare-bones VR stalker-like that people are elevating due to the lack of good VR titles? Maybe youre just really good at this game?Either way, you grab the objective, stuff it in your now very full backpack and head home. You deposit your first objective item, get your reward, a sawed off shotgun. Not like you need it, you did just fine with your starter handgun last time.You get the itch to go out again, you dont pack much to save space for all the loot youre gonna find, and with how easy it was last time this wont be a problem. You head off again into the radius.Same place, different objective, further away this time. You dip between the anomalies dotted around without any issues, seeing a run down shack a off-course from your objective you feel like now is the time for a bit of looting. A shadowy monster is making its way toward you so you decide quickly, run over and stab it to save a bullet. You draw your knife and walk over, these things arent much of a threat. Then a gunshot rings out, you lose a bit of health, you spin around to see where it was coming from. The top of that run-down shack. Suddenly in your distraction the monster you thought was not a threat hits you, you lash out with your knife only to drop it. No time to pick it up, youre being shot at. The only cover is that abandoned shack so you sprint toward it, firing at the mysterious gunman as you go, before the pistol goes click click click.You make it into the shack, reload your gun, wishing now youd brought more than two mags. You rummage through the room to find some supplies, but you just find a handful of sunflower seeds and a pack of smokes. The gunman on the roof is taunting you, yelling things in disjointed, unsettling voices. Wheeere aaaare yooooou It mocks.The commotion has attracted attention, shadowy figures are converging on the shack. You think about running for it, only to realise its night now, you cant see a thing, you reach for your flashlight only to realise in your hurry to leave your home-base you left it it there. So now you have two options. Run in the dark, crater-pocked and monster-ridden track back home blindly following your map, or try to hold out until daybreak.You remember the shotgun holstered on your back. six shots. Better make them all count. You make sure you have your knives in easy to reach places, you load your last mag in your pistol, counting all the shots you have, maybe saving one for yourself. You remember the pack of cigarettes. You put one to your lips, light it up, level your shotgun at the door and wait. You dont plan to die tonight, but you also didnt plan for this game to be so damn good.Buy it. And just like that, Into the Radius has solved the mystery of why VR games tend to suck. Its because they tend to be VR first, games second but Into the Radius is a game first, VR second - even if VR is an integral part of the experience. In other words, itd be a cool game even if it wasnt in VR.How cool are we talking? My ankles and feet were killing me from standing all day, the skin on my face got messed up from wearing the headset too much use cream, peeps, and I sometimes still try picking up stuff by looking at them and squeezing. So, pretty cool, Id say.Stalkers Distant CousinA lot of people seem to think that this game is STALKER, but in VR - but thats only marginally true. Both STALKER and Radius were inspired by the same 1971 novel, Roadside Picnic, and honestly, Radius is a lot more Picnic-like than STALKER. So dont come in expecting STALKER - there are similarities, but thats about it.I wont write too much about that, since discovering the whats and the whys was a lot of fun for me instead Ill say that its a very solitary experience. Youll never encounter another human - which is not to say that nothing will try to kill you. Yes, there will be hostile entities, and some of them will be more... human-like than others.Gun Nuts ParadiseLuckily, there are guns at your disposal! Pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, marksman rifles... so many. Too many, perhaps. Im not much of a gun person, and I gotta say, I got completely overwhelmed by sheer variety of kill toys youre given to play with.In, say, HL Alyx, you have a pistol, a shotgun, an SMG you know. A weapon for every occasion. Here there are multiple calibers of ammunition, all of which have sub-types FMJ, AP, CHP, P, Subsonic, and every ammunition caliber has its own set of weapons to use, some of which have multiple versions! You want an AK? Which one? AKM, AK-74, the foldable stock one, or the newer, plastic version? Oh, be careful, AKM uses a different kind of ammo! And maybe youd prefer the good ol M4a1? At least this one has plenty of attachment rails type B! You can always add your own, though. Whats that, you have too much 9x19 ammo? You can get the good ol Glock, an M9 Beretta, or perhaps an MP5? But wait, 9x19 doesnt pierce armour so well, so consider saving up for a Desert Eagle?...Let me tell you stocking your shelves with ammo boxes, sorting out your ever-growing hoard of firearms, even cleaning your guns is something youll spend a lot of time doing. But no worries - since its in VR, its actually pretty amazing.Immersion OverloadIn fact, a lot of stuff is pretty amazing due to the fact that its VR. You eat like you would on a camping trip, by opening a can and sticking a knife into the can. You can smoke by putting a ciggy into your mouth and lighting that bastard up careful with doing it with a gun - you can shoot yourself. Using weapons - aiming, reloading, refilling your mags - all fantastic.Now, since this is a bit of a horror game, this also means that when something gets in your face... it gets in your actual face. Real men scream instead of suppressing their emotions into a trauma ball, so warn your housemates! Theres nothing quite like being surrounded by an unknown amount of unknown entities, in the dark, down to your last half-empty mag... and making it out alive.Oh, and if youre worried that this is too scary for you - there are no jumpscares, and everything that can hurt you can be seen and heard beforehand... unless you get flanked in a fight, of course. Point is, the tension in this game comes from the feeling of fighting for survival and traversing dangerous terrain with limited resources, rather than the possibility of a screaming face running up to you and killing you.Event HorizonOne last thing to mention - this is one of these games which doesnt have an active story, but rather has you take part in some events which dont make sense until much later. There is a bunch of things happening, but its mostly told via letters, audio cassettes to listen to and general environmental storytelling. If you pay attention, though, a lot of things will be clear by the time youre done with the game.I really only scratched the surface of the game in this review, but you should get the idea if this is something for you. Survival, guns, vague story, light horror... and immersion thats out of this world. I think I can say that, at the time of writing, its the best VR experience Ive ever hard. Take that for what you will.Curator Page This game is fantastic.  Dont get discouraged if you keep getting killed.  Its not a zombie killer wave game.  You have to learn the AI and out smart it. Use the proper weapon and learn when to attack, run or hide. I have completed many times and still go back and play it on PC and the oculus quest.  I recommend reading the book Road side picnic, it was the origin for the game.",
        "summary": "Up until the 2.0 release, the game had a very traditional open world map. You entered the zone from a single point, and could go anywhere on the map to explore and loot. In order to reach the norther parts of the map, you had to travel about a day past tons of dangerous shit in order to loot and stuff."

        "text": "I love the idea, and I love the atmosphere...However the games design makes it virtually unplayable.The developers intend for you to learn how things work through trial and error.Which is charming in its own way, however the death penalty is far too severe.When you die, your mission starts over, you have to run back to your body naked, and EVERYTHING has respawned.So your body will usually have a dozen enemies wandering around and you are completely naked.They give you a few knives in the base, but those are virtually useless. If you try to get close enough to stab something you basically immediately die. I dont even know why they bothered putting knives in the game.Ive had to completely restart twice before even finishing the third mission due to losing everything and being unable to get my stuff back.Also the enemies arent even worth the ammunition it costs to kill them. 1 in 3 or so will drop a damage artifact that sells for a whopping 25 dollars. A pack of ammunition is 400 dollars...The game is too frustrating to be worth my time. Update Decided to give this game another shot and Im actually having more fun. Im really enjoying the scavenging and the attention to detail with the guns. The magazine management adds a whole other element of gameplay. While the environment and the enemies are still not my ideal, Im enjoying my time in the radius aside from when Im cowering in fear. Really hoping the dev can take the guns, gameplay and systems from this developed for this game and put out an open world survival game without the paranormal stuff someday. Original review belowFirst of all, this game is overwhelmingly positively rated, so Im clearly in the minority here. But this is my two cents for those looking to venture into the radius. I didnt grow up playing Stalker, so Im aware that I dont have that connection to this game either. I wanted to like it. A full VR story driven shooter with scavenging and stuff? Sign me up! But every time I fire up this game, I play for maybe 30 minutes and then I quit for about 6 months. I just dont enjoy the combat, which for a VR shooter is a problem. I find the black squiggly enemies an uncompelling foe. If I was trading shots with raiders or soldiers, that would be cool, but shooting at shambling black shadows just doesnt do it for me. I also dislike the anomaly mechanic which means you have to keep throwing these little things on the ground in front of you to identify these spaces of invisible energy that injure you if you wander into them. I assume the purpose is to slow down movement across the map to increase the sense of scale, but it always just feels like tedious busywork to me. In short, buy it, youll probably like it - most people do. And I appreciate a dev branching out to make something original and different to the plethora of tech demos, PVP shooters and zombie games out there.But if the above resonates with you then maybe look elsewhere. This game is a love-hate relationship. Imagine one of a kind VR game that you are eager to go back to, game with great atmosphere and advanced inventory management mechanics where you play as a lone stalker. Now imagine that at the same time that game is utterly glitchy and scuffed beyond belief. A game where you find no items inside shelves and cupboards you search screenshot on product page is a lie, where AK doesnt sound like a gun, where everywhere you look some objects float in the air, and I dont mean anomalies . On top of that the developers had no money to pay a professional to translate their game to English and instead used their own skills with very bad, amateurish result. In every single part of the game something bad can be found scopes, weapon cleaning, ladders, walking across small obstacles, enemy line of sight etc. Every mechanic and idea works but is broken to some degree. I dont think thats acceptable. Nonetheless Im dedicated to finish the game because I paid for it and its still fun. You do what you want but be warned. Dont expect any level of polish.EDIT I appreciate the developers answer. These are my observations but I dont say the game is bad. Its just I was annoyed too many times while having fun, thats why my feelings are mixed. And regarding searching cupboards etc. - Im absolutely sure Ive searched entire buildings and found maybe one note or casette, apart from supply crates. I want to see the loot when I open a desk. Look how TWD Saints and Sinners does that. This game has SO MUCH potential, but between fighting with the controls you have to grip way too hard on index controllers to keep things in your hands and certain enemies mimics and sever performance issues even on low settings, its so hard to play for any extended period of time. I want to give this game a positive review so bad, but i simply cant until they work on it some more.PLEASE KEEP GOING CM GAMES!!!Edit They fixed the index controllers, and mimics are SLIGHTLY less OP.  I still cant give it a positive review because of the horrible performance issues, but thank you CM Games!!! Keep it up!! I really, really, REALLY want to love this game. But in its current form, I cannot recommend it. It has so many things going for it, but my experience is mudded too much by its flaws, which are constantly worked on however.- At one point, I will revisit this game, and rewrite my review -Cool things-The Atmosphere is very tense and keeps you on your toes most of the time. You should never let your guard down outside of your base.-The idea of going into the Zone or rather the radius to collect artefacts, Souls of monsters, retrieving lost items, or finding out what happened here is more than enough to keep you going. Especially in the beginning of the game, say, 10-15hrs ?-The gunplay is cool and very intuitive. Reloading, maintaining and using your guns is quite realistically depicted.-The anomalies are much better than in stalker, they pose are real threat here. You need to figure out how to navigate them on your own. One painful F7 after another.-The guns they implemented feel good, shooting stuff feels good. Life is good.Less cool things-Its jerky and awkward to handle your guns. Sometimes you aim shifts abruptly and causes a lot of FUN.-Saving and loading sometimes breaks your guns and loadout. The bayonet on the SKS for example looks unfolded, but the game recognizes it as folded. I find myself often enough stabbing an enemy with the barrel of my rifle.-The Endgame is bloody awful. It is too mostly too dark and confusing which you might think as a good thing for a stalker-clone, but no, iz not tovarish, Iz bad. But suddenly its waaay too bright, effectively blinding you while a group of spawns jump at you like a horde of jellybeans.  -Climbing in this game is okay, but I find myself fighting with the controls at times and falling.-The enemies are good-ish at what they are doing, but it has too little variety. Their attacks can be frustrating, especially if you want to CQC them their attack range is too big, given they have very long arms but still. Maybe reduce it by 25 and make them attack a bit slower. Also, they can hit you if you stand on a box, where they should not be able to reach you.-There are not that many artefacts. Half of them do not give you any benefits, and the ones that support you are really underwhelming. Compared to the OG Zone-crawler.  And fuug that screaming thing you have to get from the castle......... -You move a tad too stiff it doesnt feel organic. If that makes sense.-More guns. Needs more dakka.I really want this game to take off, this could be a big hit in VR-Gaming. My recommendation is to wait a few more months. Until next time,stay cheeky breeki. Its a very good game, among the best VR games out, HOWEVER, I dont think Id recommend it for people who play on Vive.The game has had a major bug in it where when you press the button to eject magazines to reload handguns it only works about 5 of the time. USUALLY instead of ejecting the magazine, itll just slowly start rotating you in place.And this is a pretty game-breaking glitch enemies kill you in just a few hits, so if you cant reliably reload your handguns Which are your main weapons for a huge chunk of the game then every fight will boil down to if the game breaks again, I lose, otherwise, I win.Id say wait until the devs fix it but, clearly they arent interested IN fixing it, as this has been a major bug for years now, and instead of working on it, theyve put all their attention into the sequel. It would be a really easy fix, too. right now, pressing down on the pad does nothing. Just make ANY pad press eject a magazine, and relegate turns to light touches Which already causes turns. IDK why the devs havent done it I know other people have asked for it. either way, cant recommend. EDIT Play the 2.0 beta before making a final decision here! Drastically different performances and generally more well-rounded. Gonna be playing more of it, had a great experience.A buggy mess with real potential. Id be logging infinitely more hours if the damn game would stop crashing for an hour. Think I had to restart about three times before I just gave up.Optimization would make this a VR masterpiece. I mean... I am a S.T.A.L.K.E.R fan to the bone cheeky breeky.I know that this game is not S.T.A.L.K.E.R i v damki, but this is besides the point.I like this game. I liked it more before the multi-map update and before the release of standalone ITR2.0.I like it because it scared the shit out of me, when I first encountered a spawn, or when I first encountered a slider that one was a 910 jumpscare... or when i first encountered the harvester... dont-turn-around out of 10 horror moment or when you suddenly hear gunshots probably aimed at you and drop to the floor.I do not like the game for its ... uncompleteness. That being- The locations are empty. So far up to kolhoz the coolest was the factory building. All other places seem too large for what they are. Even compared to the previous map. The one where you had to traverse ALL the map to get to the new places, before the tide, when there was still the harvester.- I get the open-map idea and I like the concept, but there is just... nothing to guide you. The missions exist. Yes. But they are repetitive and have no story at all.- The bugs, which get an extra section.Bugs- The worst offender is the inventory-sorting-reset bug. The bagpack is the coolest inventory system EVER, but its broken. You can define the layout yourself, it is responsive, it is customizeable, easy to, use easy to understand, but all that is thrown out the window, because 910 times after meticulously organizing your stuff it just randomly loses its position inside the bagpack and gets reset to some other, probably 000 coordinate with reset rotation. This is so annoying.Imagine hauling a boatload of habar to a safe place through the night, wasting your last bullets on some black spawn, and duelling it out with knives, hearing mimics in the dark. Climbing into the safe space and sorting through all the bullets youve collected and refilling your mags, choosing what weapon to wield the next day and whether you should continue looting or get back to the safety of the home base... Then packing all the loot back into the bagpack, grabbing a last bite of tushyonka and going to bed, just to wake up to an immersion-breaking bug that reset the positions of most of the stuff in your bag. Why even bother then, just stuff it in there and just maybe youll find whatever youre looking for during a gunfight, or maybe you wont, but unfortunately thats not even on You, thats on the game. And worst of all - thats a regression bug. The inventory system was nearly flawless before! Currently its borderline unusable. Infuriating, I would say. - Map-bugs. Remember scaling mountains in Skyrim where you were not supposed to, well forget that, here youll have difficulties in the most unexpected of places - stepping onto planks, makeshift bridges and climbing mounds that are just 1 too inclined for poor old me. Remember how we laughed at modern games for getting their asset-placement wrong, allowing entrance to the other side of the map? Theres loads of that here, but without the other-side part. Just the misplaced assets, hovering in mid-air.- Item physics. When spawned as a pickup, items are often also hovering mid-air. Alternatively they are stuck inside the surface they are lying on, and their presence can only be detected through the item-highlighter-brackets. Some objects and surfaces have physics-bodies wildly differing from their visual models, making dropped bullets either hover above ground or drop through it, never to be seen again.- Dovetailing into that - often shots are not connecting because an enemy is hiding behind a railing, which you cant shoot through.- Picking up large weapons first rotatestranslates the weapon to match your grabbing hands positionorientation, often getting it stuck in the surface it was lying on. A similar, but different bug with the cleaning paper - when holding that with your left hand, the hand itself is offset.- Ah, right, weapong cleaning. This brings me to game balance, which is not a bug, its like that by design. I dislike the direction they went with having the store be the primary source of equipment. It is way too cheap. Same goes for the repair feature. There is no penalty to mistreating your equipment. There is no reason to go looting. Just do some missions, get some artifacts, sell them and voila, you have enough money to buy everything in top quality. There is no reason to clean your weapon with a toothbrush. Just repair for  at the base. About the cleaning nice mechanic, but terribly inconsistent. Sometimes the toothbrush connects with dirt, sometimes it doesnt. The ramrod introduces its own set of bugs.- Audio. Sometimes the tape-playback at home base randomly stops, even though you did not move an inch from the terminal.- Last, but not least - lighting. The light system is not to be underestimated, or understated, but the system that we have is far from pleasantcomplete. During dusk and dawn youre effectively blind, even though the sky is stillalready well-illuminated. Enemies are all black except for armored ones, so good luck spotting them agains a black backdrop on black ground. Its fine at night though, when its supposed to be pitch black.TLDRI am kinda sad that the focus of the studio is now on ITR2.0, which is a full standalone game with basically all the same, but improved stuff, while 1.0 is not even close to being done. So even though I havent played 2.0 yet, Id recommend starting with that, in the hopes that it has less bugs and is polished more. I dont know why this isnt marked as being in early access. It isnt done yet. I refunded it just before the 2hr mark, but there are some serious bugs and a lack of variety. Keep an eye on it, but dont buy it just yet.Edit One of the developers responded. I encountered plenty of bugs, especially at the beginning of the campaign pistol duplication glitch, items dropping out of my hands all of the time, hands glitching through tables. The lack of variety Im speaking of is in reference to the enemies. They are also extremely unpredictable and unbalanced. I played two or three missions. The pricing of items is also unbalanced, taking much of my enjoyment out of the experience.The game has a really interesting premise. I just wish you would have polished it more before declaring it finished. A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad. The game is amazing in the first 12 ish hours, anything after can be a slog to get through. Enemies can be really smart in some situations, but dumb in others. For example, one time I was stuck in a house with a swarm of enemies outside, they spoke and made all weird noises. Scared me more than anything has for the past 5 years. Then, the part that felt odd was they were all standing at the doorway, doing nothing. They were all grouped up, acting as if the doorway was blocking them. So while I was terrified for 10 mins, once I realised they couldnt enter the house all immersion was lost.Okay, one issue isnt enough for a bad review, so what else are the issues?Enemiess hearing range so, you get a mission to collect some papers in the middle of the map. You see the spawned enemies ahead. Shooting some, eventually disposing of most of their numbers. YOU THINK. Well now enemies in a building, close to the edge of the map heard the gunshots, now you have to fight every single Enemy that heard the gunshot in that building. So in a sense its cool, they react to the environment, but also the way they do can just feel robotic. After collecting the papers, in the distance I see every Enemy in the building crouched in a single file line walking in one direction. It just felt basic in that respect. Youd think they heard the fire alarm and had to evacuate the school. As a solution to hearing the game has silencers but why would I want to use one on my AK? I want to hear the gun, hear the umpf.Okay, two issues, is that enough for a negative review?Midlate game enemies The enemies mid-game are just trash. I dont like how games have taken pride on higher difficulty  more health. This game has it and sells it to you by having enemies having an armour variety as opposed to the Enemy without armour. Enemies now take 20 more shots with the AK to kill, thats how youre told you are progressing in the game. Wow. They begin to group on you, instead of the enemies taking cover and acting dynamically, they dont, the most enemies do is run, but they dont hide in corners or take any cover, its just running around, sometimes they will just push you, so aggressively a reload is the only way to resolve the situation. Because of the lack of dynamic battles, a lot of the shooting is outside, this can make some of the spawning of enemies rough in some areas. So youre outside and 10 enemies are there, they just stack up and move as one. So the tactic of difficulty in this game can just be enemies dog piling you. Wait, you have bullet sponging, Enemy dog piling... what could be worse? Well, glad you asked, some pretty op weaponry on the enemies behalf.  So now they have weapons, but some weapons can kill you within seconds. And I mean it. At this point, syringes dont feel viable, but you know what does? SAVE SCUMMING. Because of the price and also the time it takes to remove the use of a syringe, saving and reloading feel part of the game. FUN indeed.Now to end the review, a good reminder to everyone that read the entire thing. 1. all of this is obviously subjective. Some peoples pain are other peoples pleasure, and thats fair. Im just telling you what my experience was like. 2. the game is one of the few out there that has that sort of intractability and open world ness on VR, so I have to appreciate that. Its not on rails, but rather the closest game I have played to an actual fully extended VR title. It really does feel like an authentic breathing world despite some of its iffy moments, and most importantly, buy the game and form your own opinion if youre really interested in the title. I do believe the game is worth the buy, for the start of the game, price wise its one of the few VR experiences worth the money in my opinion. But it still is a far cry into what the VR gaming scene can bring. I mean, imagine how good of a game a triple A developer could make? This was made by a team I never heard of before, that also sells NFTs as a business venture on their website, its a respectable feat they have reached. Okay, my apologies to the devs in advance because my old review praised the game due to it not having any true speaking NPCs. Which is a bonus, dont get me wrong. But Into the Radius is like an abusive relationship, it is an amazing concept but is so broken and buggy most of the time that it is hard to enjoy it - especially when you beat the game because when you do, all of your save files are wiped and written over with a new game on hard mode. Thats right. It doesnt matter if you save before the final mission in every single slot on your profile, the devs programmed the game to wipe ALL of your save files if you beat the game.And while I will preface that I do recommend that you, reader, play this game, I simply cannot give it a positive review due to how unbelievably broken the ending is and how it quite literally deletes all your save files under your given profile and then forces you into a new game in Ironman mode which means you can only save in specific areas and is essentially hardmode. All of my progress is now gone, I didnt fully explore the radius and went through the core missions one by one, and now I will probably never return to what was almost an amazing experience ever again because everything I had, every weapon I found, personally cleaned, reloaded, organized, bought, all gone. Every flare I stored up, every smoke grenade I never used, every individual bullet I had to scavenge just to realize it doesnt fit my current gun so I saved it for later so I could test it out in another all gone. Deleted. All because I finished the game and did what the developers told me.While one might ask why I did not use a second save file, I did. You have 5 profiles in the menu, each with 5 save slots. I used them each differently, in case I wanted to test a new gun, try a new route on a mission, or in this case, beat the game and be able to reload back to before I beat it so I could continue playing. Nope. This game doesnt wipe that save slot, no no no, that would be too easy. Into the Radius wipes your whole fucking profile and all of your saves on it. And guess what. Once the game ends, it saves over all your progress and starts it on hardmode. I would have gladly consented to starting in hardmode, but I would have done it on another profile and not have all my fucking saves completely wiped and the 20 hours I played be completely lost.Now Im a reasonable guy, and I could be the devils advocate in this review and say But Nick, its not about the ending, its about the journey! Horse. Shit. The plot of this game is an absolute turd and revolves around finding statues of a little girl and having the plot progress around her little pity story. I dont give two shits about some random little girl, Im fighting for my goddamn life here against anomalies, monsters, and armed men and Ive got better things to do than babysit this little brat. The ending of the story is somewhat obvious, and I assume theres even multiple endings. Too goddamn bad Ill never get to see them all because my saves were all wiped!Into the Radius is a bit of a buggy mess and has a slue of issues. Items dont always work and disappear constantly, saving the game in populated areas can cause extreme lag, saving can cause the weapon in your hand to disappear, enemies with firearms tend to be able to know your exact position the very moment your pinkie toe moves out from behind a rock, and so forth. The level design can either be genius or absolute shit. I could go on for a while on the issues this game has, but they honestly didnt matter to me. For the first 20 hours I played this gem, it was amazing and I loved every second because the concept of the game is great and the depth is amazing.There is a huge arsenal of weaponry to choose from, tons of different ammo types, weapon maintenance, and everything is broken down to the tiniest detail. You can pour ammo from boxes into your magazines or put in bullets individually, your weapons, mags, and equipment will get dirty and worn so you have to care for them in a variety of ways. The SKS I used had a bayonet which had to be pulled out when in use and could be retracted whenever I wanted it to be in case I did not want to wear it down on accident if firing at an enemy from afar while being attacked by other melee assailants! The depth is fantastic and I wanted to try out every gun, every ammo type, every method of going on the offensive or defensive in every area. I wanted to find every hidden cache of firearms, ammunition, medical devices, special anomalies which you can use to outwit your enemies. But nope. Games wiped.Hell, theres even small cassette tapes you can find around the radius which inform you on what many of the anomalies and enemies are and how to combat or avoid them. Other tapes give you some lore of the area in a very unique way. Some of the tapes are even crackling music which really puts you on edge the whole time. The atmosphere this game produces is fantastic. Too bad Ill never pick it up again because all my saves were wiped.I can live with the bugs. I can live with the borderline gamebreaking glitches. But what I cannot live with is the absolute shitstorm of an ending which was provided. Without providing any spoilers, the ending location sucks big time. There are way too many enemies just thrown about in very cheap ways. And I get it, some of you will be thinking , Git gud lololol! But honestly, I had an absurd amount of cash in this game and bought the best assault rifle with all of its attachments, tons of weaponry, grenades, health syringes, smokes, food, useful anomalies you name it, I had it and was ready for war. But stacking several machine gun wielding enemies in a compressed stairwell isnt fun. All it does is cause me to repeatedly savescum and then load over and over and over and over and over again. It was madness and got to the point where I used the OC-33, a starting pistol, to beat the game because it had a red dot sight, a suppressor, and a magazine size of 27 with one in the chamber. In the main game I can totally see why the AR would work like magic, but the only time you can fully afford to buy it and deck it out is near the final mission of the game. The mission that may I remind you totally burns all your save files so you can never play them again. Oh and did I mention when you save the game all the items near you begin to freak the fuck out? Because to beat the game you need to strike the final statue of the little girl who is puking exposition all the time and the FUCKING STATUE BREAKS ON ITS OWN WHILE SAVING! This means that any time I savescummed just to be able to get to the end, the statue would break and I would be immediately be teleported to the ending room. So any time I had to save I would have to load again and again, and pray that my gun didnt just disappear out of my hand so I wouldnt have to load again and again. It was a horrible experience and really broke my heart because I was prepared for something which would blow me away like the rest of the game. But it was all going to be worth it, once I dealt with this dumb little bitch and ended the story I could either keep playing onward or reload an old save.But no. My saves were wiped. All of them. This isnt a bug. This is just how the game works. And that was the final nail in the coffin. Again, this game is like an abusive relationship because it is such a fantastic premise only to be squandered and shit on by broken mechanics, a fucked up save system, and the deletion of all your save files being not a bug, but a FEATURE.If you really like the look of it, buy the game. Itll be worth all the horrible bugs and brokenness which you absolutely will put up with. But never, EVER, finish the game. Hell, the reason Im so upset is because it was such a great concept but was totally fucked by a ridiculous feature which should have never gone past being a thought in a developers head. Even if i kinda liked it so far, i can not recommend it at this stage.Edit for Dev The gameplay loop is just not satisfying enough. Sure there are some locations but they are mostly empty. Enemy variety is also really lackluster. The only thing i really like about the game are the guns and their handling. Other than that its just, accept missiongo inget mission item get out repeat. The loot in the world is not worth the time to explore since most orange chests yield mostly garbage. The metal chests are cool but they are so few in number that it doesnt matter. You mostly rely on grinding missions as fast as possible to get good weapons. Im a huge Stalker fan and I really tried to like this game. I really tried, but this entire game just feels like wasted potential.Right now, the game is in very early access state even though it is advertised as a finished product.Graphics are mostly washed out, blurry textures. Enemies dont even have any textures at all and just appear as black shape.Weapon handling is extremely unrealistic and unbalanced. Guns deteriorate so quickly that you need to clean and maintain a weapon after every second magazine fired and you need to clean and  maintain each magazine as well while youre at it. Knives break automatically after a few uses no matter their original state.Most of the time is spent repairing and cleaning guns and walking through an extremely ugly landscape, which quickly gets rather boring. Of course youre attacked by enemies quite often, but since they are only colorless shapes, they dont exactly make things more interesting either. There are also only very basic difficulty settings, so the game is unforgivingly difficult no matter the setting. But the absolut worst are the bugs. Almost everything in this game seems to be bugged. Things keep disappearing without a reason or appearing sometimes. You keep getting stuck in objects all the time, with body parts or equipmentguns and so do the enemies, which can actually be helpful sometimes. The savegames are frequently messed up. If youre lucky, they just get renamed and you only have to figure out which was which. If youre not so lucky, theyre gone altogether.An especially interesting bug happens if you die. When you die - which you will do plenty - the game leaves you the options to reload a savegame, to continue which means to respawn in the base without your gear or to quit the game.Guess what happens when you choose to quit the game.. sadly, its not quitting the game. Instead the game deliberately overwrites your latest savegame with you being dead, so to quit here means the same as destroy all my gear and then overwrite my savegame. I cant help but wonder if this is even a bug at all.. no software can really have such obvious errors. Maybe the developers thought this was funny? Well, I do not.So Im sorry to say that there is no Stalker feeling about this game at all. In its recent state, this game is basically a buggy, ugly gun cleaning simulator.Dont get me wrong, this game has had huge potential. It could have been a gem. But it just isnt.Update I have waited for two updates now to see if the game improves and if the known bugs and problems are being addressed. Instead, the developers have mostly added new stuff instead of fixing the broken stuff that is already there. No real issues have been fixed. So I assume that wont happen anytime soon.. Im really sorry to see this kind of potential being wasted like this.And I guess I will be watching that two hour refund time limit very closely from now on when I buy a new game.My advice on this game save your money. 2.0 changed everything, mostly for the worse. Yeah 1.0 was buggy and unoptimized but what it lacked in structure, it made up for in atmosphere, discovery and open endedness.I wouldnt recommend it any more, its just another mission based VR shooter now with apocalyptic elements, just with more tedious steps between accepting the mission and getting to the objective. After 23 hours i finally finished the game pretty sure at least 5 of those hours were loading and all i can say is that i am disappointed. The game at first is fun and exciting until you suffer from the poor optimisation, crap load of glitches and crashes and poorly programmed AI. Dont get me wrong i did at some parts of the game have fun but that was overshadowed by all the annoying stuff i mentioned earlier. This game has potential but the developer is focusing on adding new guns and attachments and gun cleaning systems instead of fixing optimisation, glitches, AI and map. I recommend buying boneworks or half-life alyx, but if you have no VR games left to play then this might be worth a try but its just not as good as it looks in its current state. Also the ending kinda sucked. An interesting concept, but the general jank with the controls is just too much for it to be really enjoyable.Quick list of annoyances because I cant be arsed to make a full review - Virtual body rotates, following headset orientation. This means the stuff you want to grab gun, items in your pouch, map... will routinely be in random locations, forcing you to visually check where, for instance, your goddamn hip is so you can grab your gun. Unreliability for basic controls like this is a massive no-no for any type of game- Game gaslights you with stealth  meaning it does not actually exist. Armed enemies will spot you from half-way across the map, in total darkness, while youre crouching, unless youre literally behind solid cover no, bushes and stuff dont count. Meaning as long as theres an unobstructed line of sight, theyll see you, theyll shoot you, and they wont miss unless you keep running- Items you put in your backpack and pouch will routinely just... move around. Like they sprouted a pair of little legs while you werent looking to go say hi to their pal on the other side of your backpack. Grabbing stuff from your backpack is already a pain as it is when it starts filling up, but this makes it straight up unbearable- Saves sometimes just... break. Like Ill die, load the latest autosave, and itll turn out that it somehow saved AFTER I died, kept my full loadout, and teleported me to a completely random spot on the map. So Ill have to load whatever save was before that one.- Blink movement doesnt know what to do with slopes most of the time. Meaning you can walk up them just fine with normal movement, but youll just remain stuck in place if you try to blink up them. Normal movement makes me nauseous so I have to rely on blink movement. I guess its true what they say about bugs surviving the apocalypse Its not that i dont recommend the game just nobody seems to point out this has the worst hand and headset tracking of any VR game i have. It can make the game unplayable. and encounters frustrating. The physics are a mess. saving the game can make random objects just fly out of the sky box. The longer your save goes the worse these problems get too. This game has way too many good reviews with these problems and it really makes the 30 doller asking price seem like it should have been a 20 doller asking price. You will have fun i have played a good amount but he clunky nature of this game really mounts against the combat and gameplay that really require it not to be Even with my specs this game is horribly optimised, that also includes jumping through 7-8 optimisation hoops.Ignore this game completely  just enjoy fully modded S.T.A.L.K.E.R instead. Has to be a definite memory leak in this game.CPU  AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz 6-Core ProcessorCPU Cooler  Corsair iCUE H100i ELITE CAPELLIX 75 CFM Liquid CPU CoolerMemory  Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16 GB 2 x 8 GB DDR4-3200 CL16 MemoryGPU  ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3070 V2 OC Edition 8GB GDDR6 PCI This review used to be positive. It also used to be a meme before I spent a serious amount of time in the past few days both on and offline, streaming it for people looking for VR games, and realized the genuine amount of work that has gone into this. We assumed the studio had just sold out for more sales at first, what with the clear focus on gunplay now more prevalent than ever, but no, we were wrong.Make no mistake, this game is still pretty amazing for an indie team, but the complete 180 in atmosphere and gameplay personally is a downgrade for me.Theres lots of positive to say about this game, from the great ambiance, the STALKER-esque designs, extensive lore, shooter gameplay, fallout-esque background music etc., but its held back completely by conflicting game designs, and everything just being so damn bland and drab. Its all brown, rust and black, with some hints of red now and then to assure you, yes you still have your eyes open.  Fortunately, the anomalies are a spectacle to behold, and the weirdness and frankly bizarre twists of the geometry counteracts the lack of distinct visuals present in the environment.The conversion from 1.0 to 2.0 seemed to focus intensly on expanding upon the world as is, fixing a proper day night cycle, that actually has visible light, clearly distinct landmarks and a believable infrastructure to it. It also focxussed on gamifying the game, which I am most definitely not a fan of.To start things offThe game is too dark. Most notably indoors, there seems to be a fine layer of vantablack covering everything just enough so any direct light is immediately absorbed, making it very hard to focus on objects you are working on. During dusk, dawn and night hours, most of the environment is completely invisible, and the already incredibly dark enemies completely disappear against the background, making most fights insanely unfair unless you power through to get to the higher levels. This is counteracted by getting your first mounted headlamp after 2 or 3 missions by just stealthing through them, very slowly, which lets you see further in the dark, but also is a giant shiny beacon for the enemy to immediately snap fire at, further increasing the imbalance of the playing field against you.Fortunately, there is fun to be had in exploring the landscape itself, plus looting regions always feels like a good dopamine hit, regardless of the quality of the loot and slowness of the main character. Sorting the stuff you found between usable and sellable is charming on its own, and anyone that has played any STALKER-like games will know this feeling.Im not a fan of the constant walking and insane time factor, which makes me feel like Im babysitting a toddler, with hunger, sleep deprivation and broken equipment. Repairing items was a fun little mini game for a while, but gets really tedious and boring very, very fast. I miss a lot of detail there, such as disassembling items to repair. That could make it exciting, and expand upon the area of manual upgrades etc. For now, its mostly a good time waster in between wipes.The sound design leaves a lot to be desired, and the engine does not play well with spatial sound dolbydtsxsonic, causing sounds to be played at insanely loud volumes. The sound options breaks on every load, which means turning problematic sounds down does not work, and after a while, I just gave up going into the options menu to fix the bars to the right position.The voice acting as far as its present is pretty average, sounds like the good old 90s where they asked random people in the office to record a few lines.The weapon models are servicable, but the offsetalignment on a lot of them is completely broken, which makes it near impossible for me to use some of them. PhysicalVirtual stock doesnt help in this case, as some of the 2 handed notably all of the nato weapons are so misaligned, they simply dont work at all. As to not repeat the mistakes H3VR has made, maybe allow people to adjust their own alignments for the weapons, instead of having a database for every single type of controller out there. The misalignment also means that sometimes the grab function doesnt engage bolts and grips, which is incredibly fucked in combat situations, and has already gotten me killed a fair few times so far.For some reason, the controllers always seem to randomly disappear for a while. I havent experienced this in any other game, and there doesnt appear to be a clear trigger for this.One reproducable case is when you throw a knife at a fragment, and grab the knife afterwards, the knife will still act as if its stuck to the enemy, causing your hands to glitch out intensly.The full body appearance mode is incredibly glitchy, and easily gets stuck to geometry, twisting and turning in impossible ways, which is incredibly disorienting and also disrupts the flow of the game, I recommend turning it off and not looking back, regardless of how alluring it is.Some Geometry is clearly  unfinished. If you fall through floors, thankfully, the pause menus UNSTUCK function will allow you to teleport back to where you were standing moments prior, but it has given me several heartattacks when I was randomly launched a few miles into the sky, or seemed to randomly sink through the floor.  The worst offender is possibly curved unmeshed geometry, where items can simply disappear into the floor. This also happens on quest spawns, which means youll have to scower underneaththrough the floor to find the objective.Sometimes, grabbing items causes anything near that item to be launched into the area. I always recommend using the force-grab for this reason.Stealth is neigh impossible in this new system especially regarding sound and light. And even if you can pull it off, any situation can be solved by simply circle-strafing and blasting an enemy. They dont stop or take cover nearly as much as they should from incoming fire, and sneaking and peeking is almost always granted with a 360-snap-headshot, so it boils down to a simple case of hunt or hunted. Which does not make for very engaging Realistic gunfights.Saving and reloading will sometimes cause enemy camps to repopulate, even if you just cleared it out and are still inside of it. Which can lead to some really nasty softlocked saves.The tide, although a neat mechanic, instantly turns this into a groundhog day simulator. It becomes tedious to have to clear  the same routes over and over again. Something easily solvable with the introduction of alternate fast traveling or vehicles.p.s. I sincerely miss the interactive load screens, even if it made the loadtimes longer, the call of duty quote screen just doesnt sit well with me.p.p.s. I still believe that some core concepts of this game are perpendicular to eachother timer vs repairing, shootouts and ammo availability vs stealth, no loot drops vs economic snowballing, and I sincerely think you should split both cores up to be their own thing. One atmospheric horror survival game, one looter shooter.  Combining them can obviously work out STALKER, but requires a very specific niche of people to enjoy. VR itself is already an insanely niche platform for now, so its very hard to catch a fly with sugar mixed with citronella.Regardless of that, as masochistic as I am, the game does intrigue me enough to keep going and delve deeper into it. It has so much potential, but in its current state it just needs so much more. I want to like it! It has all of the makings of a good immersive sim, but they dont yet come together to create the dynamic moments I was hoping for. There are so many good, interesting, unique, and intuitive systems, they just dont really do much altogether at the moment. It also needs a whole lot more content.For instance, pretty much every drawer and cabinet in the game is openable, but the only things that actually seem to have loot in them are the clearly-marked loot crates, which takes the fun out of looting buildings. There are shell casing probes you can toss into anomolies to see them clearer and avoid them, but the anomolies are already pretty obvious and easy to avoid. There are food, sleep, and weapon maintenance systems but all they really add at the moment are menial tasks to keep your meters high. Even the inventory system is a very unique and realistic mechanic, but doesnt have much of an effect on gameplay besides the obvious keep your backpack tidy so you can grab things easily. On top of it all, the graphics looked awful when I played, nothing like the screenshots. The enemy designs are not that scary or interesting, so the thrill of sneaking around them gets old fast. The most thrilling moment I had in my short gameplay was trying to sneak past this headcrab-looking thing to get to a shed that looked like it would have some cool loot in it. I got there, and there was nothing! There just isnt enough in the game yet to justify pushing on, and for that reason I cant recommend it yet.I really hope they continue to push content updates, because it honestly feels like an early access game. I know the bar is low for VR, but this game could be great if they dont abandon it.",
        "summary": "The developers intend for you to learn how things work through trial and error. When you die, your mission starts over, you have to run back to your body naked, and EVERYTHING has respawned. 1 in 3 or so will drop a damage artifact that sells for a whopping 25 dollars. A pack of ammunition is 400 dollars...The game is too frustrating to be worth my time."
